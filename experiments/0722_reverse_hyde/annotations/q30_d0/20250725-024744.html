These difficulties are exacerbated by the lack of a standardized orthography in these languages, especially the highly irregular Japanese orthography and the ambiguities of the Arabic script. This paper focuses on CJK and Arabic orthographic variation and provides a brief analysis of the linguistic issues. The basic premise is that statistical methods by themselves are inadequate, and that linguistic knowledge supported by large-scale lexical databases should play a central role in achieving high accuracy in disambiguating and normalizing orthographic variants."><td>1</td><td>Exploiting Lexical Resources for Disambiguating CJK and Arabic Orthographic Variants</td><td>0.478</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Social media user generated text is actually the main resource for many NLP tasks. This text however, does not follow the standard rules of writing. Moreover, the use of dialect such as Moroccan Arabic in written communications increases further NLP tasks complexity. A dialect is a verbal language that does not have a standard orthography, which leads users to improvise spelling while writing. Thus, for the same word we can find multiple forms of transliterations. Subsequently, it is mandatory to normalize these different transliterations to one canonical word form. To reach this goal, we have exploited the powerfulness of word embedding models generated with a corpus of YouTube comments. Besides, using a Moroccan Arabic dialect dictionary that provides the canonical forms, we have built a normalization dictionary that we refer to as MANorm 1 . We have conducted several experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of MANorm, which have shown its usefulness in dialect normalization."><td>2</td><td>MANorm: A Normalization Dictionary for Moroccan Arabic Dialect Written in Latin Script</td><td>0.488</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Dialectal Arabic (DA) is the spoken vernacular for over 300M people worldwide. DA is emerging as the form of Arabic written in online communication: chats, emails, blogs, etc. However, most existing NLP tools for Arabic are designed for processing Modern Standard Arabic, a variety that is more formal and scripted. Apart from the genre variation that is a hindrance for any language processing, even in English, DA has no orthographic standard, compared to MSA that has a standard orthography and script. Accordingly, a word may be written in many possible inconsistent spellings rendering the processing of DA very challenging. To solve this problem, such inconsistencies have to be normalized. This work is the first step towards addressing this problem, as we attempt to identify spelling variants in a given textual document. We present an unsupervised clustering approach that addresses the problem of identifying orthographic variants in DA. We employ different similarity measures that exploit string similarity and contextual semantic similarity. To our knowledge this is the first attempt at solving the problem for DA. Our approaches are tested on data in two dialects of Arabic -Egyptian and Levantine. Our system achieves the highest Entropy of 0.19 for Egyptian (corresponding to 68% cluster precision) and Levantine (corresponding to 64% cluster precision) respectively. This constitutes a significant reduction in entropy (from 0.47 for Egyptian and 0.51 for Levantine) and improvement in cluster precision (from 29% for both) from the baseline."><td>3</td><td>CODACT: Towards Identifying Orthographic Variants in Dialectal Arabic</td><td>0.494</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a unified set of guidelines and resources for conventional orthography of dialectal Arabic. While Standard Arabic has well defined orthographic standards, none of the Arabic dialects do today. Previous efforts on conventionalizing the dialectal orthography have focused on specific dialects and made often ad hoc decisions. In this work, we present a common set of guidelines and meta-guidelines and apply them to 28 Arab city dialects from Rabat to Muscat. These guidelines and their connected resources are being used by three large Arabic dialect processing projects in three universities."><td>4</td><td>Unified Guidelines and Resources for Arabic Dialect Orthography</td><td>0.527</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Text normalization is an important enabling technology for several NLP tasks. Recently, neural-network-based approaches have outperformed well-established models in this task. However, in languages other than English, there has been little exploration in this direction. Both the scarcity of annotated data and the complexity of the language increase the difficulty of the problem. To address these challenges, we use a sequence-to-sequence model with character-based attention, which in addition to its self-learned character embeddings, uses word embeddings pre-trained with an approach that also models subword information. This provides the neural model with access to more linguistic information especially suitable for text normalization, without large parallel corpora. We show that providing the model with word-level features bridges the gap for the neural network approach to achieve a state-of-the-art F 1 score on a standard Arabic language correction shared task dataset."><td>5</td><td>Utilizing Character and Word Embeddings for Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Models</td><td>0.530</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Language label tokens are often used in multilingual neural language modeling and sequence-to-sequence learning to enhance the performance of such models. An additional product of the technique is that the models learn representations of the language tokens, which in turn reflect the relationships between the languages. In this paper, we study the learned representations of dialects produced by neural dialect-to-standard normalization models. We use two large datasets of typologically different languages, namely Finnish and Norwegian, and evaluate the learned representations against traditional dialect divisions of both languages. We find that the inferred dialect embeddings correlate well with the traditional dialects. The methodology could be further used in noisier settings to find new insights into language variation."><td>6</td><td>Dialect Representation Learning with Neural Dialect-to-Standard Normalization</td><td>0.536</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We recently witnessed an exponential growth in dialectal Arabic usage in both textual data and speech recordings especially in social media. Processing such media is of great utility for all kinds of applications ranging from information extraction to social media analytics for political and commercial purposes to building decision support systems. Compared to other languages, Arabic, especially the informal variety, poses a significant challenge to natural language processing algorithms since it comprises multiple dialects, linguistic code switching, and a lack of standardized orthographies, to top its relatively complex morphology. Inherently, the problem of processing Arabic in the context of social media is the problem of how to handle resource poor languages. In this talk I will go over some of our insights to some of these problems and show how there is a silver lining where we can generalize some of our solutions to other low resource language contexts."><td>7</td><td>Processing Dialectal Arabic: Exploiting Variability and Similarity to Overcome Challenges and Discover Opportunities (invited talk)</td><td>0.550</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We compare different LSTMs and transformer models in terms of their effectiveness in normalizing dialectal Finnish into the normative standard Finnish.

While the problem of extracting lexical mappings from parallel corpora is well-studied, the task is more challenging when the language samples are from nonparallel corpora. The goal of this work is to investigate one such scenario: finding lexical mappings between dialects of a diglossic language, in which people conduct their written communications in a prestigious formal dialect, but they communicate verbally in a colloquial dialect. Because the two dialects serve different socio-linguistic functions, parallel corpora do not naturally exist between them. An example of a diglossic dialect pair is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Levantine Arabic. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of a standard algorithm for inducing lexical mappings between comparable corpora(Rapp, 1999)to such diglossic corpora pairs. The focus of the paper is an in-depth error analysis, exploring the notion of relatedness in diglossic corpora and scrutinizing the effects of various dimensions of relatedness (such as mode, topic, style, and statistics) on the quality of the resulting translation lexicon."><td>11</td><td>Corpus Variations for Translation Lexicon Induction</td><td>0.563</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC) program has experimented with applying automated metrics to speech translation dialogues.

This paper provides evidence to support the hypothesis that automated measures of Arabic are lower due to variation and inflection in Arabic by demonstrating that normalization operations improve correlation between BLEU scores and Likert-type judgments of semantic adequacyas well as between BLEU scores and human judgments of the successful transfer of the meaning of individual content words from English to Arabic."><td>12</td><td>Normalization for Automated Metrics: English and Arabic Speech Translation §</td><td>0.565</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Several recent papers on Arabic dialect identification have hinted that using a word unigram model is sufficient and effective for the task.

We show that effective dialect identification requires that we account for the distinguishing lexical, morphological, and phonological phenomena of dialects.

Much of the work on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) from morphologically rich languages has shown that morphological tokenization and orthographic normalization help improve SMT quality because of the sparsity reduction they contribute.

We explore a space of tokenization schemes and normalization options. We only evaluate on detokenized and orthographically correct (enriched) output. Our results show that the best performing tokenization scheme is that of the Penn Arabic Treebank.
