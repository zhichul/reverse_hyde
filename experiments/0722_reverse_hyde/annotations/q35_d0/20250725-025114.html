In the deep learning models for RE, it has been beneficial to incorporate the syntactic structures from the dependency trees of the input sentences. In such models, the dependency trees are often used to directly structure the network architectures or to obtain the dependency relations between the word pairs to inject the syntactic information into the models via multi-task learning. The major problems with these approaches are the lack of generalization beyond the syntactic structures in the training data or the failure to capture the syntactic importance of the words for RE. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning model for RE that uses the dependency trees to extract the syntax-based importance scores for the words, serving as a tree representation to introduce syntactic information into the models with greater generalization. In particular, we leverage Ordered-Neuron Long-Short Term Memory Networks (ON-LSTM) to infer the model-based importance scores for RE for every word in the sentences that are then regulated to be consistent with the syntax-based scores to enable syntactic information injection. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on three RE benchmark datasets."><td>1</td><td>Exploiting the Syntax-Model Consistency for Neural Relation Extraction</td><td>0.363</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a novel end-to-end neural model to extract entities and relations between them. Our recurrent neural network based model captures both word sequence and dependency tree substructure information by stacking bidirectional treestructured LSTM-RNNs on bidirectional sequential LSTM-RNNs. This allows our model to jointly represent both entities and relations with shared parameters in a single model. We further encourage detection of entities during training and use of entity information in relation extraction via entity pretraining and scheduled sampling. Our model improves over the stateof-the-art feature-based model on end-toend relation extraction, achieving 12.1% and 5.7% relative error reductions in F1score on ACE2005 and ACE2004, respectively. We also show that our LSTM-RNN based model compares favorably to the state-of-the-art CNN based model (in F1-score) on nominal relation classification (SemEval-2010 Task 8). Finally, we present an extensive ablation analysis of several model components."><td>2</td><td>End-to-End Relation Extraction using LSTMs on Sequences and Tree Structures</td><td>0.389</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Background: Transfer learning aims at enhancing machine learning performance on a problem by reusing labeled data originally designed for a related, but distinct problem. In particular, domain adaptation consists for a specific task, in reusing training data developedfor the same task but a distinct domain. This is particularly relevant to the applications of deep learning in Natural Language Processing, because they usually require large annotated corpora that may not exist for the targeted domain, but exist for side domains. Results: In this paper, we experiment with transfer learning for the task of relation extraction from biomedical texts, using the TreeLSTM model. We empirically show the impact of TreeLSTM alone and with domain adaptation by obtaining better performances than the state of the art on two biomedical relation extraction tasks and equal performances for two others, for which little annotated data are available. Furthermore, we propose an analysis of the role that syntactic features may play in transfer learning for relation extraction. Conclusion: Given the difficulty to manually annotate corpora in the biomedical domain, the proposed transfer learning method offers a promising alternative to achieve good relation extraction performances for domains associated with scarce resources. Also, our analysis illustrates the importance that syntax plays in transfer learning, underlying the importance in this domain to privilege approaches that embed syntactic features."><td>3</td><td>Syntax-based transfer learning for the task of biomedical relation extraction</td><td>0.400</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We investigate the use of different syntactic dependency representations in a neural relation classification task and compare the CoNLL, Stanford Basic and Universal Dependencies schemes.

However, existing dependency-based models either neglect crucial information (e.g., negation) by pruning the dependency trees too aggressively, or are computationally inefficient because it is difficult to parallelize over different tree structures. We propose an extension of graph convolutional networks that is tailored for relation extraction, which pools information over arbitrary dependency structures efficiently in parallel. To incorporate relevant information while maximally removing irrelevant content, we further apply a novel pruning strategy to the input trees by keeping words immediately around the shortest path between the two entities among which a relation might hold. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale TACRED dataset, outperforming existing sequence and dependency-based neural models. We also show through detailed analysis that this model has complementary strengths to sequence models, and combining them further improves the state of the art."><td>5</td><td>Graph Convolution over Pruned Dependency Trees Improves Relation Extraction</td><td>0.430</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="With the recent success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Machine Translation (MT), attention mechanisms have become increasingly popular. The purpose of this paper is two-fold; firstly, we propose a novel attention model on Tree Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Tree-LSTMs), a tree-structured generalization of standard LSTM. Secondly, we study the interaction between attention and syntactic structures, by experimenting with three LSTM variants: bidirectional-LSTMs, Constituency Tree-LSTMs, and Dependency Tree-LSTMs. Our models are evaluated on two semantic relatedness tasks: semantic relatedness scoring for sentence pairs (SemEval 2012, Task 6 and SemEval 2014, Task 1) and paraphrase detection for question pairs (Quora, 2017). 1"><td>6</td><td>To Attend or not to Attend: A Case Study on Syntactic Structures for Semantic Relatedness</td><td>0.436</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Syntactic information, especially dependency trees, has been widely used by existing studies to improve relation extraction with better semantic guidance for analyzing the context information associated with the given entities. However, most existing studies suffer from the noise in the dependency trees, especially when they are automatically generated, so that intensively leveraging dependency information may introduce confusions to relation classification and necessary pruning is of great importance in this task. In this paper, we propose a dependency-driven approach for relation extraction with attentive graph convolutional networks (A-GCN). In this approach, an attention mechanism upon graph convolutional networks is applied to different contextual words in the dependency tree obtained from an offthe-shelf dependency parser, to distinguish the importance of different word dependencies. Consider that dependency types among words also contain important contextual guidance, which is potentially helpful for relation extraction, we also include the type information in A-GCN modeling. Experimental results on two English benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A-GCN, which outperforms previous studies and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on both datasets. 1"><td>7</td><td>Dependency-driven Relation Extraction with Attentive Graph Convolutional Networks</td><td>0.438</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Dependency trees convey rich structural information that is proven useful for extracting relations among entities in text. However, how to effectively make use of relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information from the dependency trees remains a challenging research question. Existing approaches employing rule based hard-pruning strategies for selecting relevant partial dependency structures may not always yield optimal results. In this work, we propose Attention Guided Graph Convolutional Networks (AGGCNs), a novel model which directly takes full dependency trees as inputs. Our model can be understood as a soft-pruning approach that automatically learns how to selectively attend to the relevant sub-structures useful for the relation extraction task. Extensive results on various tasks including cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction and large-scale sentence-level relation extraction show that our model is able to better leverage the structural information of the full dependency trees, giving significantly better results than previous approaches."><td>8</td><td>Attention Guided Graph Convolutional Networks for Relation Extraction</td><td>0.439</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Relation extraction (RE) is an important natural language processing task that predicts the relation between two given entities, where a good understanding of the contextual information is essential to achieve an outstanding model performance. Among different types of contextual information, the auto-generated syntactic information (namely, word dependencies) has shown its effectiveness for the task. However, most existing studies require modifications to the existing baseline architectures (e.g., adding new components, such as GCN, on the top of an encoder) to leverage the syntactic information. To offer an alternative solution, we propose to leverage syntactic information to improve RE by training a syntax-induced encoder on auto-parsed data through dependency masking. Specifically, the syntax-induced encoder is trained by recovering the masked dependency connections and types in first, second, and third orders, which significantly differs from existing studies that train language models or word embeddings by predicting the context words along the dependency paths. Experimental results on two English benchmark datasets, namely, ACE2005EN and SemEval 2010 Task 8 datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for RE, where our approach outperforms strong baselines and achieve state-ofthe-art results on both datasets. 1"><td>9</td><td>Improving Relation Extraction through Syntax-induced Pre-training with Dependency Masking</td><td>0.442</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Much recent work suggests that incorporating syntax information from dependency trees can improve task-specific transformer models. However, the effect of incorporating dependency tree information into pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT) remains unclear, especially given recent studies highlighting how these models implicitly encode syntax. In this work, we systematically study the utility of incorporating dependency trees into pretrained transformers on three representative information extraction tasks: semantic role labeling (SRL), named entity recognition, and relation extraction.We propose and investigate two distinct strategies for incorporating dependency structure: a late fusion approach, which applies a graph neural network on the output of a transformer, and a joint fusion approach, which infuses syntax structure into the transformer attention layers. These strategies are representative of prior work, but we introduce additional model design elements that are necessary for obtaining improved performance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that these syntax-infused transformers obtain state-of-the-art results on SRL and relation extraction tasks. However, our analysis also reveals a critical shortcoming of these models: we find that their performance gains are highly contingent on the availability of human-annotated dependency parses, which raises important questions regarding the viability of syntax-augmented transformers in real-world applications. 1"><td>10</td><td>Do Syntax Trees Help Pre-trained Transformers Extract Information?</td><td>0.448</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Relation extraction is an important task in information extraction and retrieval that aims to extract relations among the given entities from running texts. To achieve a good performance for this task, previous studies have shown that a good modeling of the contextual information is required, where the dependency tree of the input sentence can be a beneficial source among different types of contextual information. However, most of these studies focus on the dependency connections between words with limited attention paid to exploiting dependency types. In addition, they often treat different dependency connections equally in modeling so that suffer from the noise (inaccurate dependency parses) in the auto-generated dependency tree. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for relation extraction, with type-aware map memories (TaMM) for encoding dependency types obtained from an off-theshelf dependency parser for the input sentence. Specifically, for each word in an entity, TaMM maps all associated words along with the dependencies among them to memory slots and then assigns a weight to each slot according to its contribution to relation extraction. Our approach not only leverages dependency connections and types between words, but also distinguishes reliable dependency information from noisy ones and appropriately model them. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the experiments on two English benchmark datasets, where our approach achieves state-ofthe-art performance on both datasets. 1"><td>11</td><td>Relation Extraction with Type-aware Map Memories of Word Dependencies</td><td>0.449</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) aims to extract relational tuples from open-domain sentences. Traditional rule-based or statistical models have been developed based on syntactic structures of sentences, identified by syntactic parsers. However, previous neural Ope-nIE models under-explore the useful syntactic information. In this paper, we model both constituency and dependency trees into wordlevel graphs, and enable neural OpenIE to learn from the syntactic structures. To better fuse heterogeneous information from both graphs, we adopt multi-view learning to capture multiple relationships from them. Finally, the finetuned constituency and dependency representations are aggregated with sentential semantic representations for tuple generation. Experiments show that both constituency and dependency information, and the multi-view learning are effective.

State-ofthe-art models cast the task as an end-toend problem, solved incrementally using a local classifier. Yet previous work using statistical models have demonstrated that global optimization can achieve better performances compared to local classification. We build a globally optimized neural model for end-to-end relation extraction, proposing novel LSTM features in order to better learn context representations. In addition, we present a novel method to integrate syntactic information to facilitate global learning, yet requiring little background on syntactic grammars thus being easy to extend.

This paper also explores entity features and their combined features in a unified parse and semantic tree, which integrates both structured syntactic parse information and entity-related semantic information. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus shows that our dynamic syntactic parse tree outperforms all previous tree spans, and the composite kernel combining this tree kernel with a linear state-of-the-art feature-based kernel, achieves the so far best performance."><td>14</td><td>Exploiting Constituent Dependencies for Tree Kernel-based Semantic Relation Extraction</td><td>0.456</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a novel attention-based recurrent neural network for joint extraction of entity mentions and relations.

We also compare our model with an end-toend tree-based LSTM model (SPTree) byMiwa and Bansal (2016)and show that our model performs within 1% on entity mentions and 2% on relations.

We believe this is because both types of features -the contextual information captured by the linear sequences and the structured information captured by the dependency trees may complement each other. However, existing approaches largely focused on stacking the LSTM and graph neural networks such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for building improved NER models, where the exact interaction mechanism between the two different types of features is not very clear, and the performance gain does not appear to be significant. In this work, we propose a simple and robust solution to incorporate both types of features with our Synergized-LSTM (Syn-LSTM), which clearly captures how the two types of features interact. We conduct extensive experiments on several standard datasets across four languages. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better performance than previous approaches while requiring fewer parameters. Our further analysis demonstrates that our model can capture longer dependencies compared with strong baselines. 1 * Lu Xu is under the Joint PhD Program between Alibaba and Singapore University of Technology and Design.

Each approach suffers from its own disadvantage of either missing or redundant information. In this work, we propose a novel model that combines the advantages of these two approaches. This is based on the basic information in the SDP enhanced with information selected by several attention mechanisms with kernel filters, namely RbSP (Richer-but-Smarter SDP). To exploit the representation behind the RbSP structure effectively, we develop a combined deep neural model with a LSTM network on word sequences and a CNN on RbSP. Experimental results on the SemEval-2010 dataset demonstrate improved performance over competitive baselines.

Existing methods mainly focused on capturing semantic information, but suffered from ignoring the syntactic structure of the sentence, which is proved in the relation classification task to contain rich relational information. This is due to the absence of entity locations, which is the prerequisite for pruning noisy edges from the dependency tree, when extracting relational triples. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to tackle this challenge and incorporate syntactic information for relational triple extraction. First, we propose to automatically contract the dependency tree into a core relational topology and eliminate redundant information with graph pooling operations. Then, we propose a symmetrical expanding path with graph unpooling operations to fuse the contracted core syntactic interactions with the original sentence context. We also propose a bipartite graph matching objective function to capture the reflections between the core topology and golden relational facts. Since our model shares similar contracting and expanding paths with encoder-decoder models like U-Net, we name our model as Relation U-Net (RelU-Net).

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective dependency-guided LSTM-CRF model to encode the complete dependency trees and capture the above properties for the task of named entity recognition (NER). The data statistics show strong correlations between the entity types and dependency relations.

Recent NLP inroads in high-value domains have sparked interest in the more general setting of extracting n-ary relations that span multiple sentences. In this paper, we explore a general relation extraction framework based on graph long short-term memory networks (graph LSTMs) that can be easily extended to cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. The graph formulation provides a unified way of exploring different LSTM approaches and incorporating various intra-sentential and intersentential dependencies, such as sequential, syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual representation is learned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation classifier. This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enables multi-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in two important precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both conventional supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentence extraction produced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learning significantly improved extraction accuracy. A thorough analysis of various LSTM approaches yielded useful insight the impact of linguistic analysis on extraction accuracy. * This research was conducted when the authors were at Microsoft Research."><td>20</td><td>Cross-Sentence N -ary Relation Extraction with Graph LSTMs</td><td>0.473</td></tr></tbody></table>
