We develop &quot;Help, Anna!&quot; (HANNA), an interactive photo-realistic simulator in which an agent fulfills object-finding tasks by requesting and interpreting natural languageand-vision assistance. An agent solving tasks in a HANNA environment can leverage simulated human assistants, called ANNA (Automatic Natural Navigation Assistants), which, upon request, provide natural language and visual instructions to direct the agent towards the goals. To address the HANNA problem, we develop a memory-augmented neural agent that hierarchically models multiple levels of decision-making, and an imitation learning algorithm that teaches the agent to avoid repeating past mistakes while simultaneously predicting its own chances of making future progress. Empirically, our approach is able to ask for help more effectively than competitive baselines and, thus, attains higher task success rate on both previously seen and previously unseen environments. We publicly release code and data at https://github. com/khanhptnk/hanna ."><td>1</td><td>Help, Anna!

Using DSTC2 as seed data, we trained natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) networks for each agent and let the agents interact online. We model the interaction as a stochastic collaborative game where each agent (player) has a role (&quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;tourist&quot;, &quot;eater&quot;, etc.) and their own objectives, and can only interact via natural language they generate. Each agent, therefore, needs to learn to operate optimally in an environment with multiple sources of uncertainty (its own NLU and NLG, the other agent's NLU, Policy, and NLG). In our evaluation, we show that the stochastic-game agents outperform deep learning based supervised baselines."><td>2</td><td>Collaborative Multi-Agent Dialogue Model Training Via Reinforcement Learning</td><td>0.520</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We introduce a large-scale crowdsourced text adventure game as a research platform for studying grounded dialogue. In it, agents can perceive, emote, and act whilst conducting dialogue with other agents. Models and humans can both act as characters within the game. We describe the results of training state-of-the-art generative and retrieval models in this setting. We show that in addition to using past dialogue, these models are able to effectively use the state of the underlying world to condition their predictions. In particular, we show that grounding on the details of the local environment, including location descriptions, and the objects (and their affordances) and characters (and their previous actions) present within it allows better predictions of agent behavior and dialogue. We analyze the ingredients necessary for successful grounding in this setting, and how each of these factors relate to agents that can talk and act successfully."><td>3</td><td>Learning to Speak and Act in a Fantasy Text Adventure Game</td><td>0.527</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We introduce HoME: a Household Multimodal Environment for artificial agents to learn from vision, audio, semantics, physics, and interaction with objects and other agents, all within a realistic context. HoME integrates over 45,000 diverse 3D house layouts based on the SUNCG dataset, a scale which may facilitate learning, generalization, and transfer. HoME is an open-source, OpenAI Gym-compatible platform extensible to tasks in reinforcement learning, language grounding, soundbased navigation, robotics, multi-agent learning, and more. We hope HoME better enables artificial agents to learn as humans do: in an interactive, multimodal, and richly contextualized setting."><td>4</td><td>HoME: a Household Multimodal Environment</td><td>0.530</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="A long-term goal of machine learning is to build intelligent conversational agents. One recent popular approach is to train end-to-end models on a large amount of real dialog transcripts between humans(Sordoni et al., 2015;Vinyals &amp; Le, 2015;Shang et al., 2015). However, this approach leaves many questions unanswered as an understanding of the precise successes and shortcomings of each model is hard to assess. A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks(Weston et al., 2015b)which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately, those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work, we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes. Choosing the domain of movies, we provide tasks that test the ability of models to answer factual questions (utilizing OMDB), provide personalization (utilizing MovieLens), carry short conversations about the two, and finally to perform on natural dialogs from Reddit. We provide a dataset covering ∼75k movie entities and with ∼3.5M training examples. We present results of various models on these tasks, and evaluate their performance. * The first three authors contributed equally."><td>5</td><td>EVALUATING PREREQUISITE QUALITIES FOR LEARN- ING END-TO-END DIALOG SYSTEMS</td><td>0.534</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Much of NLP research has focused on crowdsourced static datasets and the supervised learning paradigm of training once and then evaluating test performance. As argued in deVries et al. (2020), crowdsourced data has the issues of lack of naturalness and relevance to real-world use cases, while the static dataset paradigm does not allow for a model to learn from its experiences of using language(Silver et al., 2013). In contrast, one might hope for machine learning systems that become more useful as they interact with people. In this work, we build and deploy a role-playing game, whereby human players converse with learning agents situated in an open-domain fantasy world. We show that by training models on the conversations they have with humans in the game the models progressively improve, as measured by automatic metrics and online engagement scores. This learning is shown to be more efficient than crowdsourced data when applied to conversations with real users, as well as being far cheaper to collect."><td>6</td><td>Dialogue in the Wild: Learning from a Deployed Role-Playing Game with Humans and Bots</td><td>0.537</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Reliable automatic evaluation of dialogue systems under an interactive environment has long been overdue. An ideal environment for evaluating dialog systems, also known as the Turing test, needs to involve human interaction, which is usually not affordable for large scale experiments. Though researchers have attempted to use metrics for language generation tasks (e.g., perplexity, BLEU) or some model-based reinforcement learning methods (e.g., self-play evaluation) for automatic evaluation, these methods only show very weak correlation with the actual human evaluation in practice. To bridge such a gap, we propose a new framework named ENIGMA for estimating human evaluation scores based on recent advances of off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. ENIGMA only requires a handful of pre-collected experience data, and therefore does not involve human interaction with the target policy during the evaluation, making automatic evaluations feasible. More importantly, ENIGMA is model-free and agnostic to the behavior policies for collecting the experience data (see details in Section 2), which significantly alleviates the technical difficulties of modeling complex dialogue environments and human behaviors. Our experiments show that ENIGMA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of correlation with human evaluation scores.Conversation Transition :P (s = s ∪ a ∪ e|s, a, incomplete conv.) = E(e|s, a), Padding with Pseudo States : P (s =PadT +1|s, a, complete conv. with T turns)=1, P (s =Pad k+1 |s = Pad k , a = NextPad, k &lt; Tmax)=1, Concatenate Conversations : P (s |s = PadT max , a = NextPad) = µ0 s ."><td>7</td><td>Towards Automatic Evaluation of Dialog Systems: A Model-Free Off-Policy Evaluation Approach</td><td>0.541</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Recent progress in dialogue generation has inspired a number of studies on dialogue systems that are capable of accomplishing tasks through natural language interactions. A promising direction among these studies is the use of reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play, for training dialogue agents. However, current datasets are limited in size, and the environment for training agents and evaluating process is relatively unsophisticated. We present AirDialogue, a large dataset that contains 402,038 goal-oriented conversations. To collect this dataset, we create a contextgenerator which provides travel and flight restrictions. We then ask human annotators to play the role of a customer or an agent and interact with the goal of successfully booking a trip given the restrictions. Key to our environment is the ease of evaluating the success of the dialogue, which is achieved by using ground-truth states (e.g., the flight being booked) generated by the restrictions. Any dialogue agent that does not generate the correct states is considered to fail. Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art dialogue models on the test dataset can only achieve a scaled score of 0.22 and an exact match score of 0.1 while humans can reach a score of 0.94 and 0.93 respectively, which suggests significant opportunities for future improvement."><td>8</td><td>AirDialogue: An Environment for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Research</td><td>0.542</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Towards bridging the gap between machine and human intelligence, it is of utmost importance to introduce environments that are visually realistic and rich in content. In such environments, one can evaluate and improve a crucial property of practical intelligent systems, namely generalization. In this work, we build House3D, a rich, extensible and efficient environment that contains 45,622 human-designed 3D scenes of houses, ranging from single-room studios to multistoreyed houses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and scene layouts, based on the SUNCG dataset . With an emphasis on semantic-level generalization, we study the task of concept-driven navigation, RoomNav, using a subset of houses in House3D. In RoomNav, an agent navigates towards a target specified by a semantic concept. To succeed, the agent learns to comprehend the scene it lives in by developing perception, understand the concept by mapping it to the correct semantics, and navigate to the target by obeying the underlying physical rules. We train RL agents with both continuous and discrete action spaces and show their ability to generalize in new unseen environments. In particular, we observe that (1) training is substantially harder on large house sets but results in better generalization, (2) using semantic signals (e.g. segmentation mask) boosts the generalization performance, and (3) gated networks on semantic input signal lead to improved training performance and generalization. We hope House3D 1 , including the analysis of the RoomNav task, serves as a building block towards designing practical intelligent systems and we wish it to be broadly adopted by the community."><td>9</td><td>BUILDING GENERALIZABLE AGENTS WITH A REALISTIC AND RICH 3D ENVIRONMENT</td><td>0.546</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The prospect of human commanders teaming with mobile robots &quot;smart enough&quot; to undertake joint exploratory tasks-especially tasks that neither commander nor robot could perform alone-requires novel methods of preparing and testing human-robot teams for these ventures prior to real-time operations. In this paper, we report work-in-progress that maintains face validity of selected configurations of resources and people, as would be available in emergency circumstances. More specifically, from an off-site post, we ask human commanders (C) to perform an exploratory task in collaboration with a remotely located human robot-navigator (Rn) who controls the navigation of, but cannot see the physical robot (R). We impose network bandwidth restrictions in two mission scenarios comparable to real circumstances by varying the availability of sensor, image, and video signals to Rn, in effect limiting the human Rn to function as an automation stand-in. To better understand the capabilities and language required in such configurations, we constructed multi-modal corpora of time-synced dialog, video, and LIDAR files recorded during task sessions. We can now examine commander/robot dialogs while replaying what C and Rn saw, to assess their task performance under these varied conditions."><td>10</td><td>(no title)</td><td>0.546</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Building intelligent agents that can communicate with and learn from humans in natural language is of great value. Supervised language learning is limited by the ability of capturing mainly the statistics of training data, and is hardly adaptive to new scenarios or flexible for acquiring new knowledge without inefficient retraining or catastrophic forgetting. We highlight the perspective that conversational interaction serves as a natural interface both for language learning and for novel knowledge acquisition and propose a joint imitation and reinforcement approach for grounded language learning through an interactive conversational game. The agent trained with this approach is able to actively acquire information by asking questions about novel objects and use the justlearned knowledge in subsequent conversations in a one-shot fashion. Results compared with other methods verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.1 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/XWorld 2 We use the term agent interchangeably with learner."><td>11</td><td>Interactive Language Acquisition with One-shot Visual Concept Learning through a Conversational Game</td><td>0.550</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We teach goal-driven agents to interactively act and speak in situated environments by training on generated curriculums. Our agents operate in LIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019)-a large-scale crowd-sourced fantasy text adventure game wherein an agent perceives and interacts with the world through textual natural language. Goals in this environment take the form of character-based quests, consisting of personas and motivations. We augment LIGHT by learning to procedurally generate additional novel textual worlds and quests to create a curriculum of steadily increasing difficulty for training agents to achieve such goals. In particular, we measure curriculum difficulty in terms of the rarity of the quest in the original training distribution-an easier environment is one that is more likely to have been found in the unaugmented dataset. An ablation study shows that this method of learning from the tail of a distribution results in significantly higher generalization abilities as measured by zeroshot performance on never-before-seen quests."><td>12</td><td>Situated Dialogue Learning through Procedural Environment Generation</td><td>0.551</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Given a simple request (e.g., Put a washed apple in the kitchen fridge), humans can reason in purely abstract terms by imagining action sequences and scoring their likelihood of success, prototypicality, and efficiency, all without moving a muscle.Once we see the kitchen in question, we can update our abstract plans to fit the scene. Embodied agents require the same abilities, but existing work does not yet provide the infrastructure necessary for both reasoning abstractly and executing concretely. We address this limitation by introducing ALFWorld, a simulator that enables agents to learn abstract, text-based policies in TextWorld(Côté et al., 2018)and then execute goals from the ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al., 2020) in a rich visual environment. ALFWorld enables the creation of a new BUTLER agent whose abstract knowledge, learned in TextWorld, corresponds directly to concrete, visually grounded actions. In turn, as we demonstrate empirically, this fosters better agent generalization than training only in the visually grounded environment. BUTLER's simple, modular design factors the problem to allow researchers to focus on models for improving every piece of the pipeline (language understanding, planning, navigation, visual scene understanding, and so forth).

We train and evaluate this system in interaction with a simulated human tutor, which is built on the BURCHAK corpusa Human-Human Dialogue dataset for the visual learning task. The results show that: 1) The learned policy can coherently interact with the simulated user to achieve the goal of the task (i.e. learning visual attributes of objects, e.g. colour and shape); and 2) it finds a better trade-off between classifier accuracy and tutoring costs than hand-crafted rule-based policies, including ones with dynamic policies."><td>14</td><td>Learning how to learn: an adaptive dialogue agent for incrementally learning visually grounded word meanings</td><td>0.554</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This talk introduces new research that works towards an overarching model of natural face-to-face conversation about spatially-located actions in the world, and then uses that model to implement a trustworthy embodied conversational agent to guide users' ongoing, real-world activities away from the desktop."><td>15</td><td>Dialogue Systems that can Handle Face-to-Face Joint Reference to Actions in Space</td><td>0.555</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In open-domain dialogue intelligent agents should exhibit the use of knowledge, however there are few convincing demonstrations of this to date.

Use of knowledge has so far proved difficult, in part because of the lack of a supervised learning benchmark task which exhibits knowledgeable open dialogue with clear grounding. To that end we collect and release a large dataset with conversations directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. We then design architectures capable of retrieving knowledge, reading and conditioning on it, and finally generating natural responses.

This approach can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently.

We introduce a dataset of such demonstrations in a crafting-based grid world. Our model consists of a high-level language generator and low-level policy, conditioned on language. We find that human demonstrations help solve the most complex tasks. We also find that incorporating natural language allows the model to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and to learn quickly from a few demonstrations.

The game involves two players: a Teller and a Drawer. The Teller sees an abstract scene containing multiple clip art pieces in a semantically meaningful configuration, while the Drawer tries to reconstruct the scene on an empty canvas using available clip art pieces. The two players communicate with each other using natural language. We collect the CoDraw dataset of ∼10K dialogs consisting of ∼138K messages exchanged between human players. We define protocols and metrics to evaluate learned agents in this testbed, highlighting the need for a novel crosstalk evaluation condition which pairs agents trained independently on disjoint subsets of the training data.

Subjective experiences about a product can be a valuable source of information. This is also true in sales conversations, where a customer and a sales assistant exchange facts and opinions about products. However, training an AI for such conversations is complicated by the fact that language models do not possess authentic opinions for their lack of realworld experience. We address this problem by leveraging product reviews as a rich source of product opinions to ground conversational AI in true subjective narratives. With Opinion-Conv, we develop the first conversational AI for simulating sales conversations. To validate the generated conversations, we conduct several user studies showing that the generated opinions are perceived as realistic.

With further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data, the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. In experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1) domain adaptation and 2) single-to-multiple domain transfer. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning.

Most of the existing approaches perform dramatically worse in unseen environments as compared to seen ones. In this paper, we present a generalizable navigational agent. Our agent is trained in two stages. The first stage is training via mixed imitation and reinforcement learning, combining the benefits from both off-policy and on-policy optimization. The second stage is fine-tuning via newly-introduced 'unseen' triplets (environment, path, instruction). To generate these unseen triplets, we propose a simple but effective 'environmental dropout' method to mimic unseen environments, which overcomes the problem of limited seen environment variability. Next, we apply semi-supervised learning (via back-translation) on these droppedout environments to generate new paths and instructions.

The first one focuses on chatting with users and making them engage in the conversations, where selecting a proper topic to fit the dialogue context is essential for a successful dialogue. The other one focuses on a specific task instead of casual talks, e.g., finding a movie on Friday night, playing a song. These two directions have been studied separately due to their different purposes. However, how to smoothly transition from social chatting to task-oriented dialogues is important for triggering the business opportunities, and there is no any public data focusing on such scenarios. Hence, this paper focuses on investigating the conversations starting from open-domain social chatting and then gradually transitioning to taskoriented purposes, and releases a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations for encouraging this research direction. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a framework to automatically generate many dialogues without human involvement, in which any powerful opendomain dialogue generation model can be easily leveraged. The human evaluation shows that our generated dialogue data has a natural flow at a reasonable quality, showing that our released data has a great potential of guiding future research directions and commercial activities.

The typical workflow is to first repeatedly run self-play (SP) to build a policy pool and then train the final adaptive policy against this pool. A crucial limitation of this framework is that every policy in the pool is optimized w.r.t. the environment reward function, which implicitly assumes that the testing partners of the adaptive policy will be precisely optimizing the same reward function as well. However, human objectives are often substantially biased according to their own preferences, which can differ greatly from the environment reward. We propose a more general framework, Hidden-Utility Self-Play (HSP), which explicitly models human biases as hidden reward functions in the self-play objective. By approximating the reward space as linear functions, HSP adopts an effective technique to generate an augmented policy pool with biased policies. We evaluate HSP on the Overcooked benchmark. Empirical results show that our HSP method produces higher rewards than baselines when cooperating with learned human models, manually scripted policies, and real humans. The HSP policy is also rated as the most assistive policy based on human feedback.Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a promising approach for many challenging decision-making problems. Particularly in competitive settings, AIs developed by MARL algorithms based on self-play (SP) defeated human professionals in a variety of domains (Silver et al., 2018; Vinyals et al., 2019; Berner et al., 2019). This empirical evidence suggests a new direction of developing strong AIs that can directly cooperate with humans in a similar &quot;model-free&quot; fashion, i.e., via self-play.Different from zero-sum games, where simply adopting a Nash equilibrium strategy is sufficient, an obvious issue when training cooperative agents by self-play is convention overfitting. Due to the existence of a large number of possible optimal strategies in a cooperative game, SP-trained agents can easily converge to a particular optimum and make decisions solely based on a specific behavior pattern, i.e., convention (Lowe et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020), of its co-trainers, leading to poor generalization ability to unseen partners. To tackle this problem, recent works proposed a two-staged framework by first developing a diverse policy pool consisting of multiple SP-trained policies, which possibly cover different conventions, and then further training an adaptive policy against this policy pool (Lupu et al., 2021; Strouse et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2021).Despite the empirical success of this two-staged framework, a fundamental drawback exists. Even though the policy pool prevents convention overfitting, each SP-trained policy in the pool remains a solution, which is either optimal or sub-optimal, to a fixed reward function specified by the underlying cooperative game. This implies a crucial generalization assumption that any test-time partner * Equal contribution † Corresponding Author prospects of the human-robot collaboration.

Recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode.

We demonstrate that low parameter models can simultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while improving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework that accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout multiturn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic responses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing transactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital assistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4 public benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -Sensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish comparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%."><td>91</td><td>Low-Resource Adaptation of Open-Domain Generative Chatbots , Raviteja Anantha</td><td>0.592</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="On-line dialogue policy learning is the key for building evolvable conversational agent in real world scenarios. Poor initial policy can easily lead to bad user experience and consequently fail to attract sufficient real users for policy training. We propose a novel framework, companion teaching, to include a human teacher in the on-line dialogue policy training loop to address the cold start problem. Here, dialogue policy is trained using not only user's reward but also teacher's example action as well as estimated immediate reward at turn level. Simulation experiments showed that, with a small number of human teaching dialogues, the proposed approach can effectively improve user experience at the beginning and smoothly lead to good performance with more user interaction data."><td>92</td><td>On-line Dialogue Policy Learning with Companion Teaching</td><td>0.592</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a new data-driven methodology for simulation-based dialogue strategy learning, which allows us to address several problems in the field of automatic optimization of dialogue strategies: learning effective dialogue strategies when no initial data or system exists, and determining a data-driven reward function. In addition, we evaluate the result with real users, and explore how results transfer between simulated and real interactions. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn multimodal dialogue strategies by interaction with a simulated environment which is &quot;bootstrapped&quot; from small amounts of Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) data. This use of WOZ data allows data-driven development of optimal strategies for domains where no working prototype is available. Using simulation-based RL allows us to find optimal policies which are not (necessarily) present in the original data. Our results show that simulation-based RL significantly outperforms the average (human wizard) strategy as learned from the data by using Supervised Learning. The bootstrapped RL-based policy gains on average 50 times more reward when tested in simulation, and almost 18 times more reward when interacting with real users. Users also subjectively rate the RL-based policy on average 10% higher. We also show that results from simulated interaction do transfer to interaction with real users, and we explicitly evaluate the stability of the data-driven reward function."><td>93</td><td>Learning and Evaluation of Dialogue Strategies for New Applications: Empirical Methods for Optimization from Small Data Sets</td><td>0.592</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal(LeCun et al., 2015). However, most current research focuses instead on important but narrow applications, such as image classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of concrete desiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a minimum.DESIDERATA FOR THE EVALUATION OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCERather than trying to define intelligence in abstract terms, we take a pragmatic approach: we would like to develop AIs that are useful for us. This naturally leads to the following desiderata.Communication through natural language An AI will be useful to us only if we are able to communicate with it: assigning it tasks, understanding the information it returns, and teaching it new skills. Since natural language is by far the easiest way for us to communicate, we require our useful AI to be endowed with basic linguistic abilities. The language the machine is exposed to in the testing environment will inevitably be very limited. However, given that we want the machine to also be a powerful, fast learner (see next point), humans should later be able to teach it more sophisticated language skills as they become important to instruct the machine in new domains. In concrete, the environment should not only expose the machine to a set of tasks, but provide instructions and feedback about the tasks in simple natural language. The machine should rely on this form of linguistic interaction to efficiently solve the tasks."><td>94</td><td>COMMAI: EVALUATING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS A USEFUL GENERAL AI</td><td>0.593</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="During the recent Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC), a fundamental question was raised: &quot;Would better performance in dialog state tracking translate to better performance of the optimized policy by reinforcement learning?&quot; Also, during the challenge system evaluation, another nontrivial question arose: &quot;Which evaluation metric and schedule would best predict improvement in overall dialog performance?&quot; This paper aims to answer these questions by applying an off-policy reinforcement learning method to the output of each challenge system. The results give a positive answer to the first question. Thus the effort to separately improve the performance of dialog state tracking as carried out in the DSTC may be justified. The answer to the second question also draws several insightful conclusions on the characteristics of different evaluation metrics and schedules."><td>95</td><td>Extrinsic Evaluation of Dialog State Tracking and Predictive Metrics for Dialog Policy Optimization</td><td>0.593</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn question-answering dialogue policies for a real-world application.

A simulated user is built based on this model and used for learning the dialogue policy of the virtual characters using RL.

Although, the current approaches improved the response quality, but they over-look the training signals present in the dialogue data. We can leverage these signals to generate the weakly supervised training data for learning dialog policy and reward estimator, and make the policy take actions (generates responses) which can foresee the future direction for a successful (rewarding) conversation. We simulate the dialogue between an agent and a user (modelled similar to an agent with supervised learning objective) to interact with each other. The agent uses dynamic blocking to generate ranked diverse responses and explorationexploitation to select among the Top-K responses. Each simulated state-action pair is evaluated (works as a weak annotation) with three quality modules: Semantic Relevant, Semantic Coherence and Consistent Flow. Empirical studies with two benchmarks indicate that our model can significantly out-perform the response quality and lead to a successful conversation on both automatic evaluation and human judgment. 1"><td>97</td><td>WeaSuL π : Weakly Supervised Dialogue Policy Learning: Reward Estimation for Multi-turn Dialogue</td><td>0.593</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In this paper, we investigate the problem of vision and language navigation.

We show that such multi-tasking improves over a BERT pretrained baseline, largely due to multi-tasking with very large dialogue datasets in a similar domain, and that the multi-tasking in general provides gains to both text and image-based tasks using several metrics in both the finetune and task transfer settings.

A promising direction to tackle this problem is to generate synthetic dialogues by prompting large language models. In this work, we use a small set of expert-written conversations as incontext examples to synthesize a social conversation dataset using prompting 1 . We perform several thorough evaluations of our synthetic conversations compared to human-collected conversations. This includes various dimensions of conversation quality with human evaluation directly on the synthesized conversations, and interactive human evaluation of chatbots fine-tuned on the synthetically generated dataset. We additionally demonstrate that this prompting approach is generalizable to multiparty conversations, providing potential to create new synthetic data for multi-party tasks. Our synthetic multi-party conversations were rated more favorably across all measured dimensions compared to conversation excerpts sampled from a human-collected multi-party dataset. * Work done during internship at Amazon Alexa AI 1 https://github.com/alexa/PLACES Yeah, I grew up there."><td>100</td><td>PLACES: Prompting Language Models for Social Conversation Synthesis</td><td>0.594</td></tr></tbody></table>
