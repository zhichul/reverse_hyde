Evaluation of a human-machine dialogue system is a difficult problem for which neither the objectives nor the proposed solutions gather a unanimous support. Traditional approaches in the ergonomics field evaluate the system by describing how it fits the user in the user referential of practices. However, the user referential is even more complicated to formalise, and one cannot ground a common use context to enable the comparison of two systems, even if they are merely an evolution of the same service. We propose to shift the point of view on the evaluation problem : instead of evaluating the system in interaction with the user in the user's referential, we will now measure the user's adequacy to the system in the system referential. This is our Copernician revolution : for the evaluation purpose, our system is no longer user-centric, because the user referential is not properly objectifiable, while the system referential is completely known by design.Mots-clés : Évaluation, Dialogue."><td>4</td><td>Nouveau paradigme d'évaluation des systèmes de dialogue homme-machine</td><td>0.557</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This article focuses on the analysis and prediction of corrections, defined as turns where a user tries to correct a prior error made by a spoken dialogue system.

These include considerations regarding the selection of appropriate regression parameters, normalization effects on the accuracy of the prediction, the influence of speech-recognition errors on the performance function, and the selection of an appropriate user-satisfaction measure.

We show that current State-ofthe-Art methods are improving their capability to distinguish translations with and without critical errors and to penalize the first accordingly.

An important observation is that, upon a request for keypad entry, users are frequently unresponsive to the extent of waiting for a time-out or hanging up the phone. The second half concerns a pilot experiment investigating the feasibility of replacing the solicitation of a keypad entry with that of a &quot;speak-and-spell&quot; entry.

Specifically, two distribution-wise metrics, FBD and PRD, are developed and evaluated. Experiments on several dialogue corpora show that our proposed metrics correlate better with human judgments than existing metrics."><td>19</td><td>Assessing Dialogue Systems with Distribution Distances</td><td>0.575</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Improved Performance in Spoken Natural Language Dialog SystemsSince approximately the mid 1980's, technology has been adequate (if not ideal) for researchers to construct spoken natural language dialog systems (SNLDS) in order to test theories of natural language processing and to see what machines were capable of based on current technological limits. Over the course of time, a few systems have been constructed in sufficient detail and robustness to enable some evaluation of the systems. For the most part, these systems were greatly limited by the available speech recognition technology. Continuous speech systems required speaker dependent training and restricted vocabularies, but still had such a large number of misrecognitions that this tended to be the limiting factor in the success of the system. For example, testing in 1991 of the Circuit Fix-It Shop of (Smith, Hipp, and Biermann, 1995) required an experimenter to remain in the room in order to notify the user when misrecognitions occurred. Fortunately, speech recognition capabilities are improving, and systems are being constructed that allow individuals to walk up and use them after a brief orientation. One example is the TRAINS system of(Allen et al., 1995)that was demonstrated at the 1995 ACL conference, where people just sat down and used the system after a brief set of instructions were given to them by the demonstrator. Another example is the current system under development at Duke University that serves as a tutor for liberal arts students learning the basics of Pascal programming. In this system, the machine itself explains how to use it. More thorough and challenging methods of evaluation are now feasible. This paper proposes some measures for evaluation based on a retrospective look at measures used in the past, analyzing their relevance in today's environment.For the future, expect measurements of speech recognition performance and basic utterance under-standing to remain important, but there should also be more emphasis on measuring robustness and measuring the utility of domain-independent knowledge about dialog. Furthermore, we should expect realtime response from evaluated systems, a sharp reduction in the amount of specialized training for using systems, and the use of longitudinal studies to see how user behavior evolves.Fundamentals in EvaluationLinguistic CoverageA forward looking view of evaluation is offered by(Whittaker and Stenton, 1989). It is forward looking in the sense that they investigated issues in evaluation independent of building a system. Their perspective was not based on a specific SNLDS, but a general analysis of the issue of evaluation. Their main point was that evaluation needed to be placed within the context of a system's use. Consequently, they used a Wizard of Oz study in an information retrieval environment (e.g., database query) in order to identify the types of natural language inputs a typical user would use in order to gain access to needed information. Their analysis identified the following requirements for the linguistic coverage of a dialog system in the information retrieval environment: (1) operators for specifying the properties of the set of objects for which information would be requested;(2) contextual references; and (3) references to the actual source of information (e.g., the database). In general, linguistic coverage of SNLDS in the past has been limited, and to the extent that limitations will exist in the next generation of SNLDS, such limitations need to be measured and described.Early System Performance Measures(Biermann, Fineman, and Heidlage, 1992) report on the results of testing their VIPX system of the mid 1980's which offers users the ability to display and 37"><td>20</td><td>Performance Measures for the Next Generation of Spoken Natural Language Dialog Systems</td><td>0.577</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality. Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and systemlevel. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation."><td>21</td><td>Towards an Automatic Turing Test: Learning to Evaluate Dialogue Responses</td><td>0.577</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper presents the results of an analysis of user reactions towards system failures in turn-taking in human-computer dialogues.

In addition, when the user utterance ends soon after the overlap starts, the possibility of the utterance being discontinued is high. Based on this analysis, it is suggested that the degradation in speech recognition performance can be predicted using utterance overlapping information."><td>22</td><td>Analysis of User Reactions to Turn-Taking Failures in Spoken Dialogue Systems</td><td>0.582</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The demonstrator presents a test-bed for collecting data on human-computer dialogue: a fully automated dialogue system that can perform Map Task with a user.

To address this, this paper presents a novel task of self-assessment of autocorrection performance based on interactions between text message users. As part of this investigation, we collected a dataset of autocorrection mistakes from true text message users and experimented with a rich set of features in our self-assessment task.

It provides an excellent review of the research, with particularly relevant discussions of error handling and system evaluation, and is suitable both as an introduction to this research area and as a survey of current state-of-the-art techniques.The book is structured into seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the research area and briefly introduces the topics covered in the book. The end of the chapter consists of a list of links to tools and components that can be used for dialogue system development, which-although currently useful-seems likely to go out of date quickly.Chapter 2 addresses the task of dialogue management, beginning by describing simple graph-and frame-based methods for dialogue control, and continuing with a discussion of VoiceXML. The chapter ends with an extended discussion of recent work in statistical approaches to dialogue control and modeling. It is unfortunate that the discussion of other methods such as the information state approach and plan-based models is postponed to Chapter 4, but otherwise this chapter provides a good summary of both classic and recent approaches.Chapter 3 discusses error handling, which is divided into three processes: error detection, error prediction (i.e., the online prediction of errors based on dialogue features), and error recovery. After surveying a range of previous approaches to these three subtasks, the authors go on to discuss several more recent, data-driven approaches. Error handling is both a vital component of any spoken dialogue system designed for realworld use and an active area of current research, so this compact summary of techniques and issues is welcome.Chapter 4 contains case studies illustrating a range of dialogue control strategies and models. It begins with a description of the information state approach, and then moves on to discuss plan-based approaches as exemplified in the TRAINS and TRIPS projects. This is followed by a discussion of two systems that employ software agents for dialogue management: the Queen's Communicator and the AthosMail system. Finally, two systems which make use of statistical models are presented: the Microsoft Bayesian receptionist, which models conversation as decision making under uncertainty, and the DIHANA system, which employs corpus-based dialogue management.
