We address this issue by introducing language-specific modules, which allows us to grow the total capacity of the model, while keeping the total number of trainable parameters per language constant. In contrast with prior work that learns languagespecific components post-hoc, we pre-train the modules of our Cross-lingual Modular (X-MOD) models from the start. Our experiments on natural language inference, named entity recognition and question answering show that our approach not only mitigates the negative interference between languages, but also enables positive transfer, resulting in improved monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Furthermore, our approach enables adding languages post-hoc with no measurable drop in performance, no longer limiting the model usage to the set of pre-trained languages."><td>4</td><td>Lifting the Curse of Multilinguality by Pre-training Modular Transformers</td><td>0.565</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper describes the submission made by the MMS team to the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) shared task 2015.

We consider a number of different methods to boost classification performance, such as feature selection and data filtering, but we ultimately find that a simple naïve Bayes classifier using character and word n-gram features is a strong baseline that is difficult to improve on, achieving an average accuracy of 0.8746 across the six tasks."><td>8</td><td>Experiments in Sentence Language Identification with Groups of Similar Languages</td><td>0.585</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="For many (minority) languages, the resources needed to train large models are not available.

By combining the new lexical layers and fine-tuned Transformer layers, we achieve high task performance for both target languages.

Nowadays, researchers are constantly putting efforts in utilizing the language relatedness to improve the performance of various NLP systems such as cross lingual semantic search, machine translation (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2020), sentiment analysis systems, etc. So in this paper, we performed an extensive case study on similarity involving languages of the Indian subcontinent. Language similarity prediction is defined as the task of measuring how similar the two languages are on the basis of their lexical, morphological and syntactic features. In this study, we concentrate only on the approach to calculate lexical similarity between Indian languages by looking at various factors such as size and type of corpus, similarity algorithms, subword segmentation, etc. The main takeaways from our work are: (i) Relative order of the language similarities largely remain the same, regardless of the factors mentioned above, (ii) Similarity within the same language family is higher, (iii) Languages share more lexical features at the subword level."><td>12</td><td>How do different factors Impact the Inter-language Similarity?

We introduce a newly annotated corpus of Algerian user-generated comments comprising parallel annotations of Algerian written in Latin, Arabic, and code-switched scripts, as well as annotations for sentiment and topic categories.

To this end, we introduce a new method to quickly infer a multilingual alignment of words, using the co-occurrence of words in a massively parallel text (MPT) to simultaneously align a large number of languages. The idea is that a simultaneous multilingual alignment yields a more adequate clustering of words across different languages than the successive analysis of bilingual alignments. Since the method is computationally demanding for a larger number of languages, we reformulate the problem using sparse matrix calculations. The usefulness of the approach is tested on an MPT that has been extracted from pamphlets of the Jehova's Witnesses.

Cananical Correlation Analysis (CCA) of the internal representations of a pretrained, multilingual BERT model reveals that the model partitions representations for each language rather than using a common, shared, interlingual space. This effect is magnified at deeper layers, suggesting that the model does not progressively abstract semantic content while disregarding languages. Hierarchical clustering based on the CCA similarity scores between languages reveals a tree structure that mirrors the phylogenetic trees hand-designed by linguists. The subword tokenization employed by BERT provides a stronger bias towards such structure than character-and wordlevel tokenizations. We release a subset of the XNLI dataset translated into an additional 14 languages at https://www.github. com/salesforce/xnli_extension to assist further research into multilingual representations."><td>27</td><td>BERT is Not an Interlingua and the Bias of Tokenization</td><td>0.605</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a method for translating texts between close language pairs.

We show this bias via a novel method for comparing the fluency of multilingual models to the fluency of monolingual Spanish and Greek models: testing their preference for two carefully-chosen variable grammatical structures (optional pronoun-drop in Spanish and optional Subject-Verb ordering in Greek). We find that multilingual BERT is biased toward the English-like setting (explicit pronouns and Subject-Verb-Object ordering) as compared to our monolingual control language model.

While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall."><td>74</td><td>Causes and Cures for Interference in Multilingual Translation</td><td>0.625</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a new method for estimating vector space representations of words: embedding learning by concept induction.

In this paper we perform a multilingual exploration of the space of common-place similes, by mining a large body of Chinese similes from the web and comparing these to the English similes harvested byVeale and Hao (2007). We demonstrate that while the simile-frame is inherently leaky in both languages, a multilingual analysis allows us to filter much of the noise that otherwise hinders the knowledge extraction process. In doing so, we can also identify a core set of stereotypical descriptions that exist in both languages and accurately map these descriptions onto a multilingual lexical ontology like HowNet.
