However, the practical impact of exposure bias is under debate. In this paper, we link exposure bias to another well-known problem in NMT, namely the tendency to generate hallucinations under domain shift. In experiments on three datasets with multiple test domains, we show that exposure bias is partially to blame for hallucinations, and that training with Minimum Risk Training, which avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam size. Our results provide a new justification for methods that reduce exposure bias: even if they do not increase performance on in-domain test sets, they can increase model robustness to domain shift."><td>1</td><td>On Exposure Bias, Hallucination and Domain Shift in Neural Machine Translation</td><td>0.584</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, but their exposure bias problem, described as the input mismatch between training and sampling, lacks in-depth exploration.In this paper, we systematically investigate the exposure bias problem in diffusion models by first analytically modelling the sampling distribution, based on which we then attribute the prediction error at each sampling step as the root cause of the exposure bias issue.Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to this issue and propose an intuitive metric for it.Along with the elucidation of exposure bias, we propose a simple, yet effective, training-free method called Epsilon Scaling to alleviate the exposure bias.We show that Epsilon Scaling explicitly moves the sampling trajectory closer to the vector field learned in the training phase by scaling down the network output (Epsilon), mitigating the input mismatch between training and sampling.Experiments on various diffusion frameworks (ADM, DDPM/DDIM, EDM, LDM), unconditional and conditional settings, and deterministic vs. stochastic sampling verify the effectiveness of our method.Remarkably, our ADM-ES, as a SOTA stochastic sampler, obtains 2.17 FID on CIFAR-10 under 100-step unconditional generation.The code is available at https://github.com/forever208/ADM-ESand https://github.com/forever208/EDM-ESWe point out that the exposure bias problem in diffusion models lacks in-depth exploration.For example, there is no proper metric to quantify the exposure bias and no explicit error analysis for it.To shed light on exposure bias, we conduct a systematical investigation in this paper by first"><td>2</td><td>ELUCIDATING THE EXPOSURE BIAS IN DIFFUSION MODELS</td><td>0.595</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Current language generation models suffer from issues such as repetition, incoherence, and hallucinations. An often-repeated hypothesis is that this brittleness of generation models is caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, also referred to as exposure bias. In this paper, we verify this hypothesis by analyzing exposure bias from an imitation learning perspective. We show that exposure bias leads to an accumulation of errors, analyze why perplexity fails to capture this accumulation, and empirically show that this accumulation results in poor generation quality."><td>3</td><td>Why Exposure Bias Matters: An Imitation Learning Perspective of Error Accumulation in Language Generation</td><td>0.599</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Exposure bias refers to the train-test discrepancy that seemingly arises when an autoregressive generative model uses only ground-truth contexts at training time but generated ones at test time. We separate the contributions of the model and the learning framework to clarify the debate on consequences and review proposed counter-measures. In this light, we argue that generalization is the underlying property to address and propose unconditional generation as its fundamental benchmark. Finally, we combine latent variable modeling with a recent formulation of exploration in reinforcement learning to obtain a rigorous handling of true and generated contexts. Results on language modeling and variational sentence auto-encoding confirm the model's generalization capability."><td>4</td><td>Generalization in Generation: A closer look at Exposure Bias</td><td>0.628</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This work focuses on relating two mysteries in neural-based text generation: exposure bias, and text degeneration. Despite the long time since exposure bias was mentioned and the numerous studies for its remedy, to our knowledge, its impact on text generation has not yet been verified. Text degeneration is a problem that the widely-used pre-trained language model GPT-2 was recently found to suffer from(Holtzman et al., 2020). Motivated by the unknown causation of the text degeneration, in this paper we attempt to relate these two mysteries. Specifically, we first qualitatively and quantitatively identify mistakes made before text degeneration occurs. Then we investigate the significance of the mistakes by inspecting the hidden states in GPT-2. Our results show that text degeneration is likely to be partly caused by exposure bias. We also study the self-reinforcing mechanism of text degeneration, explaining why the mistakes amplify. In sum, our study provides a more concrete foundation for further investigation on exposure bias and text degeneration problems."><td>5</td><td>Relating Neural Text Degeneration to Exposure Bias</td><td>0.638</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of a student network. The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels for supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies(Müller et al., 2019;Yuan et al., 2020)revealed an intriguing property of the soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the student network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization aims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear for training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance tradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe that during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further, under the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the distillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some specific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples lead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically find that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates distillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel weighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise biasvariance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.

The optimization of calibration is essential to many online advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the downstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers. Despite its importance, calibration often suffers from a problem called &quot;maximization bias&quot;. Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions are achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the training and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we quantify maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing (VAD) meta-algorithm in this paper. The algorithm is efficient, robust, and practical as it is able to mitigate maximization bias problem under covariate shifts, without incurring additional online serving costs or compromising the ranking performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using a state-of-the-art recommendation neural network model on a large-scale real-world dataset."><td>7</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 CALIBRATION MATTERS: TACKLING MAXIMIZATION BIAS IN LARGE-SCALE ADVERTISING RECOMMENDA- TION SYSTEMS</td><td>0.647</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Morphological inflection, like many sequence-to-sequence tasks, sees great performance from recurrent neural architectures when data is plentiful, but performance falls off sharply in lowerdata settings. We investigate one aspect of neural seq2seq models that we hypothesize contributes to overfitting -teacher forcing. By creating different training and test conditions, exposure bias increases the likelihood that a system too closely models its training data. Experiments show that teacher-forced models struggle to recover when they enter unknown territory. However, a simple modification to the training algorithm to more closely mimic test conditions creates models that are better able to generalize to unseen environments.

Identifying patterns of overgeneralization requires evaluation methods that are both reliable and scalable. We propose contrastive conditioning as a reference-free blackbox method for detecting disambiguation errors. Specifically, we score the quality of a translation by conditioning on variants of the source that provide contrastive disambiguation cues. After validating our method, we apply it in a case study to perform a targeted evaluation of sequence-level knowledge distillation. By probing word sense disambiguation and translation of gendered occupation names, we show that distillation-trained models tend to overgeneralize more than other models with a comparable BLEU score. Contrastive conditioning thus highlights a side effect of distillation that is not fully captured by standard evaluation metrics. Code and data to reproduce our findings are publicly available. 1"><td>9</td><td>Contrastive Conditioning for Assessing Disambiguation in MT: A Case Study of Distilled Bias</td><td>0.656</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In an era of increasingly large pre-trained language models, knowledge distillation is a powerful tool for transferring information from a large model to a smaller one. In particular, distillation is of tremendous benefit when it comes to real-world constraints such as serving latency or serving at scale. However, a loss of robustness in language understanding may be hidden in the process and not immediately revealed when looking at high-level evaluation metrics. We investigate the hidden costs: what is &quot;lost in distillation&quot;, especially in regards to identity-based model bias using the case study of toxicity modeling. With reproducible models using open source training sets, we investigate models distilled from a BERT teacher baseline. Using both open source and proprietary big data models, we investigate these hidden performance costs."><td>10</td><td>Lost in Distillation: A Case Study in Toxicity Modeling</td><td>0.659</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Knowledge distillation is widely used to transfer the language understanding of a large model to a smaller model. However, after knowledge distillation, it was found that the smaller model is more biased by gender compared to the source large model. This paper studies what causes gender bias to increase after the knowledge distillation process. Moreover, we suggest applying a variant of the mixup on knowledge distillation, which is used to increase generalizability during the distillation process, not for augmentation. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the gender bias amplification after knowledge distillation. We also conduct an experiment on the GLUE benchmark to demonstrate that even if the mixup is applied, it does not have a significant adverse effect on the model's performance. * jaime@daangn.com † This is work done during an internship in Naver CLOVA AI LAB."><td>11</td><td>Why Knowledge Distillation Amplifies Gender Bias and How to Mitigate -from the Perspective of DistilBERT</td><td>0.660</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="With the growing prevalence of large-scale language models, their energy footprint and potential to learn and amplify historical biases are two pressing challenges. Dataset distillation (DD) -a method for reducing the dataset size by learning a small number of synthetic samples which encode the information in the original dataset -is a method for reducing the cost of model training, however its impact on fairness has not been studied. We investigate how DD impacts on group bias in the context of text classification tasks, with experiments over two data sets, concluding that vanilla DD preserves the bias of the dataset. We then show how existing debiasing methods can be combined with DD to produce models that are fair and accurate, at reduced training cost. 1"><td>12</td><td>Towards Fair Supervised Dataset Distillation for Text Classification</td><td>0.662</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Joint entity and relation extraction aims to extract relation triplets from plain text directly. Prior work leverages Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models for triplet sequence generation. However, Seq2Seq enforces an unnecessary order on the unordered triplets and involves a large decoding length associated with error accumulation. These methods introduce exposure bias, which may cause the models overfit to the frequent label combination, thus limiting the generalization ability. We propose a novel Sequence-to-Unordered-Multi-Tree (Seq2UMTree) model to minimize the effects of exposure bias by limiting the decoding length to three within a triplet and removing the order among triplets. We evaluate our model on two datasets, DuIE and NYT, and systematically study how exposure bias alters the performance of Seq2Seq models. Experiments show that the state-of-the-art Seq2Seq model overfits to both datasets while Seq2UMTree shows significantly better generalization.

This is a small-domain translation task, meaning limited relevant training data with very distinct style and vocabulary. Models trained on such data are susceptible to exposure bias effects, particularly when training sentence pairs are imperfect translations of each other. This can result in poor behaviour during inference if the model learns to neglect the source sentence.The UNICAM entry addresses this problem during fine-tuning using a robust variant on Minimum Risk Training. We contrast this approach with data-filtering to remove 'problem' training examples. Under MRT finetuning we obtain good results for both directions of English-German and English-Spanish biomedical translation.In particular we achieve the best English-to-Spanish translation result and second-best Spanish-to-English result, despite using only single models with no ensembling."><td>15</td><td>Addressing Exposure Bias With Document Minimum Risk Training: Cambridge at the WMT20 Biomedical Translation Task</td><td>0.667</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Although exposure bias has been widely studied in some NLP tasks, it faces its unique challenges in dialogue response generation, the representative one-to-various generation scenario. In real human dialogue, there are many appropriate responses for the same context, not only with different expressions, but also with different topics. Therefore, due to the much bigger gap between various ground-truth responses and the generated synthetic response, exposure bias is more challenging in dialogue generation task. What's more, as MLE encourages the model to only learn the common words among different ground-truth responses, but ignores the interesting and specific parts, exposure bias may further lead to the common response generation problem, such as &quot;I don't know&quot; and &quot;HaHa?&quot; In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive switching mechanism, which learns to automatically transit between ground-truth learning and generated learning regarding the word-level matching score, such as the cosine similarity. Experimental results on both Chinese STC dataset and English Reddit dataset, show that our adaptive method achieves a significant improvement in terms of metric-based evaluation and human evaluation, as compared with the state-of-the-art exposure bias approaches.

If model retraining results in vastly different behavior, then it could cause negative effects in downstream systems, especially if this churn can be avoided with limited impact on model accuracy. In this paper, we show an equivalence between training with distillation using the base model as the teacher and training with an explicit constraint on the predictive churn. We then show that distillation performs strongly for low churn training against a number of recent baselines on a wide range of datasets and model architectures, including fully-connected networks, convolutional networks, and transformers."><td>17</td><td>CHURN REDUCTION VIA DISTILLATION</td><td>0.670</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms, including modern factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices-e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization-significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models, like exposure games, for an (ex-ante) predeployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups."><td>18</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 MODELING CONTENT CREATOR INCENTIVES ON ALGORITHM-CURATED PLATFORMS</td><td>0.671</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015)and privileged information(Vapnik &amp; Izmailov, 2015)are two techniques that enable machines to learn from other machines.

Through this, our work not only provides a useful mechanism that can improve the active learning approach, but also an explanation of the empirical successes of various existing approaches which ignore this bias.

This bound is presented both in an abstract and in a concrete form, the latter complemented by a reduction technique to handle modern computation graphs featuring convolutional layers, fully-connected layers, and skip connections, to name a few.

While much attention has been dedicated towards improvements in accuracy, there have been no attempts in the literature to evaluate social biases exhibited in NRE systems. In this paper, we create WikiGenderBias, a distantly supervised dataset composed of over 45,000 sentences including a 10% human annotated test set for the purpose of analyzing gender bias in relation extraction systems. We find that when extracting spouse and hypernym (i.e., occupation) relations, an NRE system performs differently when the gender of the target entity is different. However, such disparity does not appear when extracting relations such as birth date or birth place. We also analyze two existing bias mitigation techniques, word embedding debiasing and data augmentation. Unfortunately, due to NRE models relying heavily on surface level cues, we find that existing bias mitigation approaches have a negative effect on NRE.

In this paper, we study the problem what limits the performance of DS-trained neural models, conduct thorough analyses, and identify a factor that can influence the performance greatly, shifted label distribution. Specifically, we found this problem commonly exists in real-world DS datasets, and without special handing, typical DS-RE models cannot automatically adapt to this shift, thus achieving deteriorated performance.

Though statistically equivalent, it has been observed that resampling outperforms reweighting when combined with stochastic gradient algorithms. By analyzing illustrative examples, we explain the reason behind this phenomenon using tools from dynamical stability and stochastic asymptotics.

This empirical study illustrates that this is a quite general phenomenon when models are trained using stochastic gradient type algorithms.Our theoretical analysis and experiments show clearly that adjusting only the loss functions is not sufficient for fixing the biased data problem. The output can be disastrous if one overlooks the optimization algorithm used in the training. In fact, recent understanding has shown that objective function design and optimization algorithm are closely related, for example optimization algorithms such as SGD play a key role in the generalizability of deep neural networks.

Hence, those training examples that are correctly predicted by the biased model are flagged as being biased and are down-weighted during the training of the main model. However, assessing the importance of an instance merely based on the predictions of the biased model may be too naive. It is possible that the prediction of the main model can be derived from another decisionmaking process that is distinct from the behavior of the biased model. To circumvent this, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy that incorporates the similarity between the main and biased model attribution scores in a Product of Experts (PoE) loss function to further improve OOD performance.

This article proposes to analyze bias in the output of NLP systems using multivariate regression models. Such models provide a robust and more informative alternative which (a) generalizes to multiple bias variables, (b) can take covariates into account, (c) can be combined with measures of effect size to quantify the size of bias.

However, prior work has presented strong empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrating that importance weights can have little to no effect on overparameterized neural networks. Is importance weighting truly incompatible with the training of overparameterized neural networks? Our paper answers this in the negative. We show that importance weighting fails not because of the overparameterization, but instead, as a result of using exponentially-tailed losses like the logistic or cross-entropy loss. As a remedy, we show that polynomially-tailed losses restore the effects of importance reweighting in correcting distribution shift in overparameterized models. We characterize the behavior of gradient descent on importance weighted polynomially-tailed losses with overparameterized linear models, and theoretically demonstrate the advantage of using polynomially-tailed losses in a label shift setting. Surprisingly, our theory shows that using weights that are obtained by exponentiating the classical unbiased importance weights can improve performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our analysis with neural network experiments on a subpopulation shift and a label shift dataset. When reweighted, our loss function can outperform reweighted cross-entropy by as much as 9% in test accuracy.

We observe this behavior consistently across five datasets from computer vision and NLP. Surprisingly, increasing the abstention rate can even decrease accuracies on some groups. To better understand when selective classification improves or worsens accuracy on a group, we study its margin distribution, which captures the model's confidences over all predictions. For example, when the margin distribution is symmetric, we prove that whether selective classification monotonically improves or worsens accuracy is fully determined by the accuracy at full coverage (i.e., without any abstentions) and whether the distribution satisfies a property we term left-log-concavity.

Most recently, Cohen et al.[8]observed two important phenomena. The first, dubbed progressive sharpening, is that the sharpness steadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff 2/η. The second, dubbed edge of stability, is that the sharpness hovers at 2/η for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing, albeit non-monotonically.We demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the dynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a cubic Taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top eigenvector of the Hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local Taylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until stability is restored. This property, which we call self-stabilization, is a general property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of stability.

Yet around this point, these models have identified a simple, loss-minimising behaviour: to output the unigram distribution of the target training corpus. The use of such a heuristic raises the question: Can we initialise our models with this behaviour and save precious compute resources and model capacity? Here we show that we can effectively endow standard neural language generation models with a separate module that reflects unigram frequency statistics as prior knowledge, simply by initialising the bias term in a model's final linear layer with the log-unigram distribution. We use neural machine translation as a test bed for this simple technique and observe that it: (i) improves learning efficiency; (ii) achieves better overall performance; and perhaps most importantly (iii) appears to disentangle strong frequency effects by encouraging the model to specialise in non-frequency-related aspects of language. * Work done during internship at DeepMind. 1 Notably, void of contextual clues, models of human language processing (Morton, 1969)  would default to similar strategies.

While traditional methods were based on hand-crafted features, continuous representations based on neural networks recently obtained competitive results. A challenge of using such methods is to obtain supervised data to train the retriever model, corresponding to pairs of query and support documents. In this paper, we propose a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks, inspired by knowledge distillation, and which does not require annotated pairs of query and documents. Our approach leverages attention scores of a reader model, used to solve the task based on retrieved documents, to obtain synthetic labels for the retriever.

The latent code guides the pair representations and influences sentence reconstruction. Experimental results on two datasets created via distant supervision indicate that multi-task learning results in performance benefits. Additional exploration of employing Knowledge Base priors into the VAE reveals that the sentence space can be shifted towards that of the Knowledge Base, offering interpretability and further improving results 1 ."><td>86</td><td>Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction with Sentence Reconstruction and Knowledge Base Priors</td><td>0.716</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Language representations are known to carry stereotypical biases and, as a result, lead to biased predictions in downstream tasks. While existing methods are effective at mitigating biases by linear projection, such methods are too aggressive: they not only remove bias, but also erase valuable information from word embeddings. We develop new measures for evaluating specific information retention that demonstrate the tradeoff between bias removal and information retention. To address this challenge, we propose OSCaR (Orthogonal Subspace Correction and Rectification), a bias-mitigating method that focuses on disentangling biased associations between concepts instead of removing concepts wholesale. Our experiments on gender biases show that OSCaR is a well-balanced approach that ensures that semantic information is retained in the embeddings and bias is also effectively mitigated.Further, in many NLP tasks such as coreference resolution, completely losing say, gender information will not be beneficial and render pronoun resolution difficult. Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a well-studied task which examines the directional relationships between sentences and helps evaluate the associations between words in word embeddings[5]. For instance, if we take sentence pairs:Premise: A matriarch sold a watch. Hypothesis: A woman sold a watch.In a task of NLI, the objective is to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, contradicted by it, or neither (neutral to it). A GloVe-based NLI [13] model without any form of debiasing, predicts label entail with a high probability of 97%, as the information of a matriarch being a woman is correctly identified by the model.

We observe that NLP research often goes beyond the square one setup, e.g, focusing not only on accuracy, but also on fairness or interpretability, but typically only along a single dimension. Most work targeting multilinguality, for example, considers only accuracy; most work on fairness or interpretability considers only English; and so on. Such one-dimensionality of most research means we are only exploring a fraction of the NLP research search space.

Therefore, approaches that improve the accuracy -group robustness tradeoff frontier of a DNN model (i.e. improving worst-group accuracy without sacrificing average accuracy, or vice versa) is of crucial importance. Uncertainty-based active learning (AL) can potentially improve the frontier by preferentially sampling underrepresented subgroups to create a more balanced training dataset. However, the quality of uncertainty estimates from modern DNNs tend to degrade in the presence of spurious correlations and dataset bias, compromising the effectiveness of AL for sampling tail groups. In this work, we propose Introspective Self-play (ISP), a simple approach to improve the uncertainty estimation of a deep neural network under dataset bias, by adding an auxiliary introspection task requiring a model to predict the bias for each data point in addition to the label. We show that ISP provably improves the bias-awareness of the model representation and the resulting uncertainty estimates. On two realworld tabular and language tasks, ISP serves as a simple &quot;plug-in&quot; for AL model training, consistently improving both the tail-group sampling rate and the final accuracy-fairness trade-off frontier of popular AL methods. * Co-sernior authors. † Work done as a student researcher at Google.

This success suggests that some form of implicit regularization must be at work. In this paper we argue that a strong intrinsic bias in the parameter-function map helps explain the success of deep neural networks. We provide evidence that the parameter-function map results in a heavily biased prior over functions, if we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region. The PAC-Bayes theorem then guarantees good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets. We exploit connections between deep neural networks and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood, finding remarkably good agreement between Gaussian processes and neural networks for small input sets. Using approximate marginal likelihood calculations we produce nontrivial generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks. As predicted by recent arguments based on algorithmic information theory, we find that the prior probability drops exponentially with linear increases in several measures of descriptional complexity of the target function. As target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this simplicity bias offers an insight into why deep networks generalize well on real world problems, but badly on randomized data. information theory, 22(1):75-81, 1976.

With this formulation, we can characterize the convergence direction of the network parameters as singular vectors of a tensor defined by the network. For L-layer linear tensor networks that are orthogonally decomposable, we show that gradient flow on separable classification finds a stationary point of the 2/L max-margin problem in a &quot;transformed&quot; input space defined by the network. For underdetermined regression, we prove that gradient flow finds a global minimum which minimizes a norm-like function that interpolates between weighted 1 and 2 norms in the transformed input space.

The authors show that the linear coefficients of the network converges in direction to the solution of (1) with different norms: 2 norm for linear fully-connected networks, 2/L (quasi-)norm for diagonal networks, and DFT-domain 2/L (quasi-)norm for convolutional networks with full-length filters.

Through our analysis across 8 languages, we find that the variance in the performance of the distilled models due to their dependence on priors including the amount of synthetic data used for distillation, the student architecture, training hyper-parameters and confidence of the teacher models, makes distillation a brittle compression mechanism. To mitigate this, we explore the use of post-training quantization for the compression of these models.
