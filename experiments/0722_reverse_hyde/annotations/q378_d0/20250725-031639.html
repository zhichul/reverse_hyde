Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cutoff to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation -a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-theart on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) language models sample-efficiently and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain. Public knowledge. an essay concerning the social dimension of science.

However, the gradient of the log-likelihood function, i.e., the score function, is not properly defined for discrete spaces. This makes it non-trivial to adapt the score-based modeling to categorical data. In this paper, we extend diffusion models to discrete variables by introducing a stochastic jump process where the reverse process denoises via a continuous-time Markov chain. This formulation admits an analytical simulation during backward sampling. To learn the reverse process, we extend score matching to general categorical data, and show that an unbiased estimator can be obtained via simple matching of the conditional marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set of synthetic and real-world music and image benchmarks. * Work done during an internship at Google."><td>5</td><td>SCORE-BASED CONTINUOUS-TIME DISCRETE DIFFU- SION MODELS</td><td>0.583</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The integration of knowledge graphs with deep learning is thriving in improving the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

In this context, we infuse knowledge in large and small language models and study their performance, and find the performance to be similar. For the link prediction task on the Aviation Knowledge Graph, we obtain a 0.2 hits@1 score using T5-small, T5base, T5-large, and BLOOM. Using templatebased scripts, we create a set of 1 million synthetic factoid QA pairs in the aviation domain from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports. On our curated QA pairs, the three models of T5 achieve a 0.7 hits@1 score. We validate our findings with the paired student t-test and Cohen's kappa scores. For link prediction on Aviation Knowledge Graph using T5-small and T5-large, we obtain a Cohen's kappa score of 0.76, showing substantial agreement between the models. Thus, we infer that small language models perform similar to large language models with the infusion of knowledge.This section presents our approach (flow diagram in figure 1), discusses the experiment datasets, creation of AviationQA, describes the model configurations, and explains the evaluation technique."><td>6</td><td>There is No Big Brother or Small Brother: Knowledge Infusion in Language Models for Link Prediction and Question Answering</td><td>0.585</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present a novel model for the problem of"><td>7</td><td>Self-Supervised Document Similarity Ranking via Contextualized Language Models and Hierarchical Inference</td><td>0.586</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper investigates contextual word representation models from the lens of similarity analysis.

The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected.

The superior performance of diffusion models has made them an appealing tool in several applications, including inpainting, super-resolution, and semantic editing. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also serve as an instrument for semantic segmentation, especially in the setup when labeled data is scarce. In particular, for several pretrained diffusion models, we investigate the intermediate activations from the networks that perform the Markov step of the reverse diffusion process. We show that these activations effectively capture the semantic information from an input image and appear to be excellent pixel-level representations for the segmentation problem. Based on these observations, we describe a simple segmentation method, which can work even if only a few training images are provided. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing alternatives on several datasets for the same amount of human supervision. The source code of the project is publicly available.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 2. We design a simple semantic segmentation approach that exploits these representations and outperforms the alternatives in the few-shot operating point.3. We compare the DDPM-based representations with their GAN-based counterparts on the same datasets and demonstrate the advantages of the former in the context of semantic segmentation.RELATED WORKIn this section, we briefly describe the existing lines of research relevant to our work.Diffusion models(Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;Ho et al., 2020)are a class of generative models that approximate the distribution of real images by the endpoint of the Markov chain which originates from a simple parametric distribution, typically a standard Gaussian. Each Markov step is modeled by a deep neural network that effectively learns to invert the diffusion process with a known Gaussian kernel. Ho et al. highlighted the equivalence of diffusion models and score matching(Song &amp; Ermon, 2019;, showing them to be two different perspectives on the gradual conversion of a simple known distribution into a target distribution via the iterative denoising process. Very recent works(Nichol, 2021;Dhariwal &amp; Nichol, 2021)have developed more powerful model architectures as well as different advanced objectives, which led to the &quot;victory&quot; of DDPM over GANs in terms of generative quality and diversity. DDPM have been widely used in several applications, including image colorization ), super-resolution (Saharia et al., 2021Li et al., 2021b), inpainting (Song et al., 2021, and semantic editing(Meng et al., 2021). In our work, we demonstrate that one can also successfully use them for semantic segmentation."><td>10</td><td>LABEL-EFFICIENT SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS</td><td>0.591</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Knowledge graphs are a versatile framework to encode richly structured data relationships, but it can be challenging to combine these graphs with unstructured data. Methods for retrofitting pre-trained entity representations to the structure of a knowledge graph typically assume that entities are embedded in a connected space and that relations imply similarity. However, useful knowledge graphs often contain diverse entities and relations (with potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting, a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly modeling pairwise relations. Our framework can directly incorporate a variety of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph completion. Further, it allows users to encode, learn, and extract information about relation semantics. We present both linear and neural instantiations of the framework. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drug-disease treatment pairs in a large, complex health knowledge graph."><td>11</td><td>Retrofitting Distributional Embeddings to Knowledge Graphs with Functional Relations</td><td>0.593</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Diffusion probabilistic models have quickly become a major approach for generative modeling of images, 3D geometry, video and other domains. However, to adapt diffusion generative modeling to these domains the denoising network needs to be carefully designed for each domain independently, oftentimes under the assumption that data lives in a Euclidean grid. In this paper we introduce Diffusion Probabilistic Fields (DPF), a diffusion model that can learn distributions over continuous functions defined over metric spaces, commonly known as fields.We extend the formulation of diffusion probabilistic models to deal with this field parametrization in an explicit way, enabling us to define an end-to-end learning algorithm that side-steps the requirement of representing fields with latent vectors as in previous approaches  Du et al., 2021). We empirically show that, while using the same denoising network, DPF effectively deals with different modalities like 2D images and 3D geometry, in addition to modeling distributions over fields defined on non-Euclidean metric spaces. † Work was completed while P.Z. was an intern with Apple. 1  We use the terms score network/function and denoising network/function exchangeably in the paper."><td>12</td><td>DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC FIELDS</td><td>0.595</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this process to generate samples. The choice of noising process, or inference diffusion process, affects both likelihoods and sample quality. For example, extending the inference process with auxiliary variables leads to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). For any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the MDMs likelihood without requiring any model-specific analysis. We then demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over all linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and IMAGENET32 datasets. We show learned MDMs match or surpass bits-per-dims (BPDs) relative to fixed choices of diffusions for a given dataset and model architecture."><td>13</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 WHERE TO DIFFUSE, HOW TO DIFFUSE, AND HOW TO GET BACK: AUTOMATED LEARNING FOR MULTIVARI- ATE DIFFUSIONS</td><td>0.597</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semanticsimilarity of texts.

While traditional methods were based on hand-crafted features, continuous representations based on neural networks recently obtained competitive results. A challenge of using such methods is to obtain supervised data to train the retriever model, corresponding to pairs of query and support documents. In this paper, we propose a technique to learn retriever models for downstream tasks, inspired by knowledge distillation, and which does not require annotated pairs of query and documents. Our approach leverages attention scores of a reader model, used to solve the task based on retrieved documents, to obtain synthetic labels for the retriever.

In addition, we present a straightforward procedure that, without any retraining or architectural modifications, allows deep recurrent models to perform equally well (and sometimes better) when compared to shallow models. To validate our analysis, we conduct a set of consistent empirical evaluations and introduce several new sentence embedding models in the process.

We fed all these scores as features to machine learning models to obtain a single score giving the degree of similarity of the sentences. Linear Regression and Bagging models were used for this purpose. We used Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) as the corpus-based semantic relatedness measure. For the knowledgebased semantic similarity between words, a modified WordNet based Lin measure was used. Second approach uses a bipartite based method over the WordNet based Lin measure, without any modification.

To compensate for this lack, we enrich arguments with structured background knowledge to support knowledge-intense argumentation tasks. We present a new unsupervised method for constructing Contextualized Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CCKGs) that selects contextually relevant knowledge from large knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently and at high quality. Our work goes beyond context-insensitive knowledge extraction heuristics by computing semantic similarity between KG triplets and textual arguments. Using these triplet similarities as weights, we extract contextualized knowledge paths that connect a conclusion to its premise, while maximizing similarity to the argument.

One adds gradually noise to data using a diffusion to transform the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution. Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an approximation of the time-reversal of this diffusion initialized by Gaussian samples. Practically, the intractable score terms appearing in the time-reversed process are approximated using score matching techniques. We explore here a similar idea to sample approximately from unnormalized probability density functions and estimate their normalizing constants. We consider a process where the target density diffuses towards a Gaussian. Denoising Diffusion Samplers (DDS) are obtained by approximating the corresponding time-reversal. While score matching is not applicable in this context, we can leverage many of the ideas introduced in generative modeling for Monte Carlo sampling. Existing theoretical results from denoising diffusion models also provide theoretical guarantees for DDS. We discuss the connections between DDS, optimal control and Schrödinger bridges and finally demonstrate DDS experimentally on a variety of challenging sampling tasks. .

To this end, we compare contextualized models with their static counterparts. We make this comparison dependent on the application of a number of similarity measures and classifiers. Our results are threefold: Firstly, we show that the models combined with the different similarity measures differ greatly in terms of the amount of knowledge they allow for extracting. Secondly, our results suggest that similarity measures perform much worse than classifier-based approaches.

We show popular embedding models are indeed uncalibrated. That means probability estimates associated to predicted triples are unreliable. We present a novel method to calibrate a model when ground truth negatives are not available, which is the usual case in knowledge graphs. We propose to use Platt scaling and isotonic regression alongside our method. Experiments on three datasets with ground truth negatives show our contribution leads to well calibrated models when compared to the gold standard of using negatives. We get significantly better results than the uncalibrated models from all calibration methods. We show isotonic regression offers the best the performance overall, not without trade-offs. We also show that calibrated models reach state-of-the-art accuracy without the need to define relation-specific decision thresholds.INTRODUCTIONKnowledge graph embedding models are neural architectures that learn vector representations (i.e. embeddings) of nodes and edges of a knowledge graph. Such knowledge graph embeddings have applications in knowledge graph completion, knowledge discovery, entity resolution, and link-based clustering, just to cite a few(Nickel et al., 2016a).Despite burgeoning research, the problem of calibrating such models has been overlooked, and existing knowledge graph embedding models do not offer any guarantee on the probability estimates they assign to predicted facts. Probability calibration is important whenever you need the predictions to make probabilistic sense, i.e., if the model predicts a fact is true with 80% confidence, it should to be correct 80% of the times. Prior art suggests to use a sigmoid layer to turn logits returned by models into probabilities (Nickel et al., 2016a) (also called the expit transform), but we show that this provides poor calibration.Figure 1shows reliability diagrams for off-the-shelf TransE and ComplEx. The identity function represents perfect calibration. Both models are miscalibrated: all TransE combinations inFigure 1aunder-forecast the probabilities (i.e. probabilities are too small), whereas ComplEx under-forecasts or over-forecasts according to which loss is used(Figure1b).Calibration is crucial in high-stakes scenarios such as drug-target discovery from biological networks, where end-users need trustworthy and interpretable decisions. Moreover, since probabilities are not calibrated, when classifying triples (i.e. facts) as true or false, users must define relationspecific thresholds, which can be awkward for graphs with a great number of relation types.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to focus on calibration for knowledge embeddings. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we use Platt Scaling and isotonic regression to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models on datasets that include ground truth negatives. One peculiar feature of knowledge graphs is that they usually rely on the open world assumption (facts not present are not necessarily false, they are simply unknown). This makes calibration troublesome because of the lack of ground truth negatives. For this reason, our second and main contribution is a calibration heuristics that combines Platt-scaling or isotonic regression with synthetically generated negatives.Experimental results show that we obtain better-calibrated models and that it is possible to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models even when ground truth negatives are not present.

We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains -images, audio, video -and found that there is a large gap in performance between human similarity judgments and pre-trained DNNs.

We view this as strong theoretical justification for the empirical success of SGMs. We also examine SGMs based on the critically damped Langevin diffusion (CLD). Contrary to conventional wisdom, we provide evidence that the use of the CLD does not reduce the complexity of SGMs.Providing an analysis which goes beyond these limitations is a pressing first step towards theoretically understanding why SGMs actually work in practice.Concurrent work. The concurrent and independent work of [LLT23] also obtains similar guarantees to our Corollary 3.Our contributionsIn this work, we take a step towards bridging theory and practice by providing a convergence guarantee for SGMs, under realistic (in fact, quite minimal) assumptions, which scales polynomially in all relevant problem parameters. Namely, our main result (Theorem 2) only requires the following assumptions on the data distribution q, which we make more quantitative in Section 3:A1 The score function of the forward process is L-Lipschitz.A2 The second moment of q is finite.A3 The data distribution q has finite KL divergence w.r.t. the standard Gaussian.We note that all of these assumptions are either standard or, in the case of A2, far weaker than what is needed in prior work. Crucially, unlike prior works, we do not assume log-concavity, an LSI, or dissipativity; hence, our assumptions cover arbitrarily non-log-concave data distributions. Our main result is summarized informally as follows.Theorem 1 (informal, see Theorem 2). Under assumptions A1-A3, and if the score estimation error in L 2 is at most O(ε), then with an appropriate choice of step size, the SGM outputs a measure which is ε-close in total variation (TV) distance to q in O(L 2 d/ε 2 ) iterations.We remark that our iteration complexity is actually quite tight: in fact, this matches state-of-the-art discretization guarantees for the Langevin diffusion [VW19; Che+21a].We find Theorem 1 to be quite surprising, because it shows that SGMs can sample from the data distribution q with polynomial complexity, even when q is highly non-log-concave (a task that is usually intractable), provided that one has access to an accurate score estimator.

This paper studies their application as observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures, investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 MSE. A popular choice for BC in continuous action spaces approximates p(a|o) by a point-estimate that is optimised via MSE. This makes a surprisingly strong baseline in the literature despite its simplicity. However, MSE suffers from two limitations that harm its applicability to our goal of modelling the full, complex distributions of human behaviour. 1) MSE outputs a point-estimate. This precludes it from capturing any variance or multimodality present in p(a|o). 2) Due to its optimisation objective, MSE learns the 'average' of the distribution. This can bias the estimate towards more frequently occurring actions, or can even lead to out-of-distribution actions (e.g. picking the action between two modes). The first can be partially mitigated by instead assuming a Gaussian distribution, predicting a variance for each action dimension and sampling from the resulting Gaussian. However, due to the MSE objective, the learnt mean is still the average of the observed action distribution. These limitations are visualised inFigure 1.Discretised.A second popular choice is to discretise each continuous action dimension into B bins, and frame it as a classification task. This has two major limitations. 1) Quantisation errors arise since the model outputs a single value for each bin. 2) Since each action dimension is treated independently, the marginal rather than the joint distribution is learnt. This can lead to issues during sampling whereby dependencies between dimensions are ignored, leading to 'uncoordinated' behaviour. This can be observed inFigure 1where points outside of the true distribution have been sampled in the bottom-right corner. This can be remedied by modelling action dimensions autoregressively, but these models bring their own challenges and drawbacks (Lin et al., 2021).K-Means. Another method that accounts for dependencies between action dimensions, first clusters the actions across the dataset into K bins (rather than B |a| ) using K-Means. This discretises the joint-action distribution, rather than the marginal as in 'Discretised'. Each action is then associated with its nearest cluster, and learning can again be framed as a classification task. This approach Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Fleet, et al.

Compared to other 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, meshes are more desirable in practice, because (1) they enable easy and arbitrary manipulation of shapes for relighting and simulation, and (2) they can fully leverage the power of modern graphics pipelines which are mostly optimized for meshes. Previous scalable methods for generating meshes typically rely on sub-optimal post-processing, and they tend to produce overly-smooth or noisy surfaces without fine-grained geometric details. To overcome these shortcomings, we take advantage of the graph structure of meshes and use a simple yet very effective generative modeling method to generate 3D meshes. Specifically, we represent meshes with deformable tetrahedral grids, and then train a diffusion model on this direct parametrization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on multiple generative tasks.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 for computers, both voxels and point clouds are relatively hard for artists to edit, especially when the generated 3D shapes are complex and of low quality. Moreover, modern graphics pipelines are built and optimized for explicit geometry representations like meshes, making meshes one of the most desirable final 3D shape representations. While it is still possible to use methods like Poisson reconstruction to obtain surfaces from voxels and points clouds, the resulted surfaces are generally noisy and contain many topological artifacts, even with carefully tuned hyperparameters.To improve the representation flexibility, sign distance fields (SDFs) have been adopted to model shape surfaces, which enables us to use marching cubes [29] to extract the zero-surfaces and thus 3D meshes. However, SDFs are typically harder to learn as it requires a carefully designed sampling strategy and regularization. Because SDFs are usually parameterized with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in which a smoothness prior is implicitly embedded, the generated shapes tend to be so smooth that sharp edges and important (and potentially semantic) details are lost. Moreover, SDFs are costly to render and therefore less suitable for downstream tasks like conditional generation with RGB images, which require an efficient differentiable renderer during inference.We instead aim to generate 3D shapes by directly producing 3D meshes, where surfaces are represented as a graph of triangular or polygon faces. With 3D meshes, all local surface information is completely included in the mesh vertices (along with the vertex connectivity), because the surface normal of any point on the shape surface is simply a nearest neighbor or some local linear combination of vertex normals. Such a regular structure with rich geometric details enables us to better model the data distribution and learn generative models that are more geometry-aware. In light of recent advances in score-based generative modeling[16,47]where powerful generative performance and effortless training are demonstrated, we propose to train diffusion models on these vertices to generate meshes. However, it is by no means a trivial task and poses two critical problems: (1) the numbers of vertices and faces are indefinite for general object categories, and (2) the underlying topology varies wildly and edges have to be generated at the same time."><td>57</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 MESHDIFFUSION: SCORE-BASED GENERATIVE 3D MESH MODELING</td><td>0.616</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) have shown promising performance on link prediction tasks by mapping the entities and relations from a knowledge graph into a geometric space. The capability of KGEs in preserving graph characteristics including structural aspects and semantics, highly depends on the design of their score function, as well as the inherited abilities from the underlying geometry. Many KGEs use the Euclidean geometry which renders them incapable of preserving complex structures and consequently causes wrong inferences by the models. To address this problem, we propose a neuro differential KGE that embeds nodes of a KG on the trajectories of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). To this end, we represent each relation (edge) in a KG as a vector field on several manifolds. We specifically parameterize ODEs by a neural network to represent complex manifolds and complex vector fields on the manifolds. Therefore, the underlying embedding space is capable to assume the shape of various geometric forms to encode heterogeneous subgraphs.

However, these measures of deterministic representational similarity ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, both of which play important roles in neural computation. To rectify this, we generalize previously proposed shape metrics (Williams et al., 2021)  to quantify differences in stochastic representations. These new distances satisfy the triangle inequality, and thus can be used as a rigorous basis for many supervised and unsupervised analyses. Leveraging this novel framework, we find that the stochastic geometries of neurobiological representations of oriented visual gratings and naturalistic scenes respectively resemble untrained and trained deep network representations.

One way to do so is erasure: a subset of inputs is considered irrelevant if it can be removed without affecting the model prediction.

First, the objective is generally intractable, and approximate search or leave-one-out estimates are typically used instead; both approximations may be inaccurate and remain very expensive with modern deep (e.g., BERT-based) NLP models. Second, the method is susceptible to the hindsight bias: the fact that a token can be dropped does not mean that the model 'knows' it can be dropped.

However, surprisingly, we show that most natural KD-based federated learning protocols have poor performance.To investigate this, we propose a new theoretical framework, Federated Kernel ridge regression, which can capture both model heterogeneity as well as data heterogeneity. Our analysis shows that the degradation is largely due to a fundamental limitation of knowledge distillation under data heterogeneity. We further validate our framework by analyzing and designing new protocols based on KD. Their performance on real world experiments using neural networks, though still unsatisfactory, closely matches our theoretical predictions.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 Specifically, we restrict the algorithms to access the models using only two primitives (a universal model API): train on some dataset i.e. fit, and yield predictions on some inputs i.e. predict. Our goal is to be able to collaborate with and learn from any agent which provides these two functionalities.Simple algorithms. A naive such model agnostic algorithm indeed exists-agents can simply transfer their entire training data to each other and then each agent can train any model of choice on the combined dataset. However, transferring of the dataset is disallowed in federated learning. Instead, we will replace the averaging primitive in federated learning with knowledge distillation (KD)(Bucilua et al., 2006;Hinton et al., 2015). In knowledge distillation (KD), information is transferred from model A to model B by training model B on the predictions of model A on some data. Since we only access model A through its predictions, KD is a functional model-agnostic protocol.The key challenge of KD however is that it is poorly understood and cannot be formulated in the standard stochastic optimization framework like established techniques(Wang et al., 2021). Thus, designing and analyzing algorithms that utilize KD requires developing an entirely new framework and approach.

Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Qlearning (Diffusion-QL) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks. * The work was done in part during a summer internship at Twitter. † Joint senior authors; order determined by flipping a coin. arXiv:2208.06193v3 [cs.LG] 25 Aug 2023Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023ICLR     et al., 2020Yu et al., 2021); 4) treating offline RL as a problem of sequence prediction with return guidance (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021;. Our approach falls into the first category.Empirically, the performance of policy-regularized offline RL methods is typically slightly worse than that of other approaches, and here we show that this is largely because the policy regularization methods perform poorly due to their limited ability to accurately represent the behavior policy. This results in the regularization adversely affecting the policy improvement. For example, the policy regularization may limit the exploration space of the agent to a small region with only suboptimal actions and then the Q-learning will be induced to converge towards a suboptimal policy.The inaccurate policy regularization occurs for two main reasons: 1) policy classes are not expressive enough; 2) the regularization methods are improper. In most prior work, the policy is a Gaussian distribution with mean and diagonal covariance specified by the output of a neural network. However, as offline datasets are often collected by a mixture of policies, the true behavior policy may exhibit strong multi-modalities, skewness, or dependencies between different action dimensions, which cannot be well modeled by diagonal Gaussian policies(Shafiullah et al., 2022). In a particularly extreme, but not uncommon example, a Gaussian policy is used to fit bimodal training data by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the data distribution to the policy distribution. This will result in the policy exhibiting mode-covering behavior and placing high density in the middle area of the two modes, which is actually the low-density region of the training data. In such cases, regularizing a new policy towards the behavior-cloned policy is likely to make the policy learning substantially worse. Second, the regularization, such as the KL divergence and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Kumar et al., 2019), is often not well suited for offline RL. The KL divergence needs access to explicit density values and MMD needs multiple action samples at each state for optimization. These methods require an extra step by first learning a behavior cloned policy to provide density values for KL optimization or random action samples for MMD optimization. Regularizing the current policy towards the behavior cloned policy can further induce approximation errors, since the cloned behavior policy may not model the true behavior policy well, due to limitations in the expressiveness of the policy class. We conduct a simple bandit experiment in Section 4, which illustrates these issues can occur even on a simple bandit task."><td>80</td><td>DIFFUSION POLICIES AS AN EXPRESSIVE POLICY CLASS FOR OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</td><td>0.622</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Language models are trained on large volumes of text, and as a result their parameters might contain a significant body of factual knowledge.

We describe a procedure for &quot;crawling&quot; the internal knowledge-base of a language model. Specifically, given a seed entity, we expand a knowledge-graph around it. The crawling procedure is decomposed into sub-tasks, realized through specially designed prompts that control for both precision (i.e., that no wrong facts are generated) and recall (i.e., the number of facts generated).

We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling.

However, a key challenge in offline RL lies in effectively stitching portions of suboptimal trajectories from the static dataset while avoiding extrapolation errors arising due to a lack of support in the dataset. Existing approaches use conservative methods that are tricky to tune and struggle with multi-modal data (as we show) or rely on noisy Monte Carlo return-to-go samples for reward conditioning. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the expressiveness of latent diffusion to model in-support trajectory sequences as compressed latent skills. This facilitates learning a Q-function while avoiding extrapolation error via batchconstraining. The latent space is also expressive and gracefully copes with multimodal data. We show that the learned temporally-abstract latent space encodes richer task-specific information for offline RL tasks as compared to raw stateactions. This improves credit assignment and facilitates faster reward propagation during Q-learning.

Previous diffusion-based sequence modeling methods in offline RL diffused over the raw state-action space. However, the low-level trajectory space tends to be poorly suited for reasoning. Some prior works(Pertsch et al. 2021;Ajay et al. b) have proposed to instead reason in more well-conditioned spaces composed of higher-level behavioral primitives. Such temporal abstraction has been shown to result in faster and more reliable credit assignment(Machado et al. 2023;Mann and Mannor 2014), particularly in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. We harness the expressivity of powerful diffusion generative models to reason with temporal abstraction and improve credit assignment.Inspired by the recent successes of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)(Rombach et al. 2022;Jun and Nichol 2023), we propose learning similar latent trajectory representations for offline RL tasks by encoding rich high-level behaviors and learning a policy decoder to roll out low-level action sequences conditioned on these behaviors. The idea is to diffuse over semantically rich latent representations while relying on powerful decoders for high-frequency details. Prior works which explored diffusion for offline RL (Janner et al. 2022, Ajay et al. a)  directly diffused over the raw state-action space, and their architectural considerations for effective diffusion models limited the networks to be simple U-Nets (Ronneberger et al. 2015). The separation of the diffusion model from the low-level policy allows us to model the low-level policy using a powerful autoregressive decoder. We perform stateconditioned latent diffusion on the learnt latent space and then learn a Q-function over states and corresponding latents. During Q-learning, we batch-constrain the candidate latents for the target Q-function using our expressive diffusion prior, thus mitigating extrapolation error. Our final policy samples latent skills from the LDM, scores the latents using the Q-function and executes the best behavior with the policy decoder. We refer to our method as Latent Diffusion-Constrained Q-learning (LDCQ). Our method significantly improves results over previous offline RL methods, which suffer from extrapolation error or have difficulty in credit assignment in long-horizon sparse reward tasks.Related WorkOffline RL. As discussed previously, offline RL poses the challenge of distributional shift while stitching suboptimal trajectories together. Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) (Kumar et al. 2020) tries to constrain the policy to the behavioral support by learning a pessimistic Q-function that lowerbounds the optimal value function. Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) (Vieillard et al. 2022) tries to avoid extrapolation error by performing a trade-off between SARSA and DQN using expectile regression. However, it achieves the optimal batch-constrained policy only as their expectile parameter τ → 1, which leads to an increasingly difficult-to-optimize objective. Our method instead learns the optimal batch-constrained Q-function without introducing any pessimism or trade-off."><td>88</td><td>Reasoning with Latent Diffusion in Offline Reinforcement Learning</td><td>0.625</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The similarity of documents represented using static word embeddings is best measured using second-order metrics accounting for the covariance of the embeddings.

Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective.

We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing (the trace of) the covariance of training targets.

We argue that current SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics.
