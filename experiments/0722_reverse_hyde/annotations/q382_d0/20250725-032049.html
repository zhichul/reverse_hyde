This project is currently under development and it is periodically enriched with new contributions. The long-term goal is that all the speech recordings will be enriched with phonetic, syllabic, morphosyntactic, lexical and sentence ELAN-complaint annotations. A way to speed up the process of annotation is to use automatic speech-recognition-based tools tailored to the application. Therefore, CORILGA repository has been enhanced with an automatic alignment tool, available to the administrator of the repository, that aligns speech with an orthographic transcription. In the event that no transcription, or just a partial one, were available, a speech recognizer for Galician is used to generate word and phonetic segmentations. These recognized outputs may contain errors that will have to be manually corrected by the administrator. For assisting this task, the tool also provides an ELAN tier with the confidence measure of each recognized word. In this paper, after the description of the main facts of the CORILGA corpus, the speech alignment and recognition tools are described. Both have been developed using the Kaldi toolkit."><td>1</td><td>Enhanced CORILGA: Introducing the Automatic Phonetic Alignment Tool for Continuous Speech</td><td>0.462</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Ö ØØ º ÐÔÐ¹ Üº Ö RÉSUMÉ Cet article présente SPPAS, le nouvel outil du LPL pour l'alignement texte/son.

SPPAS produces automatically or semi-automatically annotations which include utterance, word, syllabic and phonemic segmentations from a recorded speech sound and its transcription. SPPAS is currently implemented for French, English, Italian and Chinese. There is a very simple procedure to add other languages in SPPAS : it is just needed to add related resources in the appropriate directories. SPPAS can be used by a large community of users : accessibility and portability are important aspects in its development. The tools and resources will all be distributed with a GPL license."><td>2</td><td>SPPAS : un outil « user-friendly » pour l'alignement texte/son</td><td>0.470</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In this paper we describe an improved algorithm for the automatic segmentation of speech corpora. Apart from their usefulness in several speech technology domains, segmentations provide easy access to speech corpora by using time stamps to couple the orthographic transcription to the speech signal. The segmentation tool we propose is based on the Forward-Backward algorithm. The Forward-Backward method not only produces more accurate segmentation results than the traditionally used Viterbi method, it also provides us with a confidence interval for each of the generated boundaries. These confidence intervals allow us to perform some advanced post-processing operations, leading to further improvement of the quality of automatic segmentations."><td>3</td><td>An Improved Algorithm for the Automatic Segmentation of Speech Corpora</td><td>0.473</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Cross-language forced alignment is a solution for linguists who create speech corpora for very low-resource languages. However, cross-language is an additional challenge making a complex task, forced alignment, even more difficult. We study how linguists can impart domain expertise to the tasks to increase the performance of automatic forced aligners while keeping the time effort still lower than with manual forced alignment. First, we show that speech recognizers have a clear bias in starting the word later than a human annotator, which results in micro-pauses in the results that do not exist in manual alignments, and study which is the best way to automatically remove these silences. Second, we ask the linguists to simplify the task by splitting long interview audios into shorter lengths by providing some manually aligned segments and evaluating the results of this process. Finally, we study how correlated source language performance is to target language performance, since often it is an easier task to find a better source model than to adapt to the target language."><td>4</td><td>Semiautomatic Speech Alignment for Under-Resourced Languages</td><td>0.491</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper describes the LDC forced aligner which is designed to align audio and transcripts. Unlike existing forced aligners, LDC forced aligner can align partially transcribed audio files, and also audio files with large chunks of non-speech segments, such as noise, music, silence etc, by inserting optional wildcard phoneme sequences between sentence or paragraph boundaries. Based on the HTK tool kit, LDC forced aligner can align audio and transcript on sentence or word level.

Such resources deserve attention for several reasons: they represent an interesting testbed for studying differences between written and spoken material and they yield low cost resources for acoustic model training. When automatically transcribing the audio data, regions of agreement between automatic transcripts and written sources allow to transfer time-codes to the written documents: this may be helpful in an audio archive or audio information retrieval environment. Regions of disagreement can be automatically selected for further correction by human transcribers. This study makes use of 10 hours of French radio interview archives with corresponding press-oriented transcripts. The audio corpus has then been transcribed using the LIMSI speech recognizer resulting in automatic transcripts, exhibiting an average word error rate of 12%. 80% of the text corpus (with word chunks of at least five words) can be exactly aligned with the automatic transcripts of the audio data. The residual word error rate on these 80% is less than 1%."><td>6</td><td>Automatic audio and manual transcripts alignment, time-code transfer and selection of exact transcripts</td><td>0.518</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="While the alignment of audio recordings and text (often termed &quot;forced alignment&quot;) is sometimes treated as a solved problem, in practice the process of adapting an alignment system to a new, under-resourced language comes with significant challenges, requiring experience and expertise that many outside of the speech community lack. This puts otherwise &quot;solvable&quot; problems, like the alignment of Indigenous language audiobooks, out of reach for many real-world Indigenous language organizations. In this paper, we describe ReadAlong Studio, a suite of tools for creating and visualizing aligned audiobooks, including educational features like time-aligned highlighting, playing single words in isolation, and variable-speed playback. It is intended to be accessible to creators without an extensive background in speech or NLP, by automating or making optional many of the specialist steps in an alignment pipeline. It is well documented at a beginner-technologist level, has already been adapted to 30 languages, and can work out-of-the-box on many more languages without adaptation."><td>7</td><td>ReadAlong Studio: Practical Zero-Shot Text-Speech Alignment for Indigenous Language Audiobooks</td><td>0.519</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This work proposes a new confidence measure for evaluating text-to-speech alignment systems outputs, which is a key component for many applications, such as semi-automatic corpus anonymization, lips syncing, film dubbing, corpus preparation for speech synthesis and speech recognition acoustic models training. This confidence measure exploits deep neural networks that are trained on large corpora without direct supervision. It is evaluated on an open-source spontaneous speech corpus and outperforms a confidence score derived from a state-of-the-art text-to-speech aligner. We further show that this confidence measure can be used to fine-tune the output of this aligner and improve the quality of the resulting alignment.Related worksEvery text-to-speech aligner faces three main challenges: (i) Handling imperfect transcriptions; (ii) Supporting noisy acoustic conditions; (iii) Finding the globally optimal alignment on long (up to a few hours) audio files.

Speech and gesture are known to exhibit a synchronous relationship in human communication; however, the precise nature of that relationship requires further investigation. The construction of computer models of multimodal human communication would be enabled by the availability of multimodal communication corpora annotated with synchronized gesture and speech features. To investigate the temporal relationships of these knowledge sources, we have collected and are annotating several multimodal corpora with time-aligned features. Forced alignment between a speech file and its transcription is a crucial part of multimodal corpus production. This paper investigates a number of factors that may contribute to highly accurate forced alignments to support the rapid production of these multimodal corpora including the acoustic model, the match between the speech used for training the system and that to be force aligned, the amount of data used to train the ASR system, the availability of speaker adaptation, and the duration of alignment segments."><td>9</td><td>Evaluating Factors Impacting the Accuracy of Forced Alignments in a Multimodal Corpus</td><td>0.526</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In the turbulent world of 2022, where mass population movements due to war and disaster are becoming increasingly common, language skills are more relevant than ever. People who wish to achieve a high level of proficiency when learning a new language benefit from reading literary texts, but many learners find this a challenging hurdle. Annotating texts with integrated audio and translations is a popular way to try and make them easier to approach. However, doing this automatically with TTS and machine translation engines produces unengaging results, while human annotation is slow and expensive. Here, we present a method that uses simple scripts and readily available computational resources for speech recognition and sentence alignment to combine public-domain resources from sites like Gutenberg and LibriVox into high-quality annotated multimedia versions of literary texts. Initial results with French texts of up to 80K words in length are promising, with audio/text word error rates under 0.25% and audio/translation word error rates around 1%, producing results that are usable after only minimal postediting. 10 https://www.ffmpeg.org/ 11 https://cloud.google.com/ speech-to-text 12 https://youalign.com/ 13 The appendix to this paper gives details on how to obtain and use the code.14 In these experiments, the beam width used was 80 tokens."><td>10</td><td>Using public domain resources and off-the-shelf tools to produce high-quality multimedia texts</td><td>0.527</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Speech-text alignment tools are frequently used in speech technology and research.

The main feature of CoALT is that a user can define its own criteria for evaluating and comparing the speech-text alignment tools since the required quality for labelling depends on the targeted application. Beyond ranking, our tool provides useful statistics for each labeller and above all about their differences and can emphasize the drawbacks and advantages of each labeller. We have applied our software for the French and English languages but it can be used for another language by simply defining the list of the phonetic symbols and optionally a set of phonetic rules. In this paper we present the usage of the software for comparing two automatic labellers on the corpus TIMIT. Moreover, as automatic labelling tools are configurable (number of GMMs, phonetic lexicon, acoustic parameterisation), we then present how CoALT allows to determine the best parameters for our automatic labelling tool."><td>11</td><td>CoALT: A Software for Comparing Automatic Labelling Tools</td><td>0.529</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Language documentation projects supported by recent funding intiatives have created a large number of multimedia corpora of typologically diverse languages. Most of these corpora provide a manual alignment of transcription and audio data at the level of larger units, such as sentences or intonation units. Their usefulness both for corpus-linguistic and psycholinguistic research and for the development of tools and teaching materials could, however, be increased by achieving a more fine-grained alignment of transcription and audio at the word or even phoneme level. Since most language documentation corpora contain data on small languages, there usually do not exist any speech recognizers or acoustic models specifically trained on these languages. We therefore investigate the feasibility of untrained forced alignment for such corpora. We report on an evaluation of the tool (Web) MAUS (Kisler et al., 2012)   on several language documentation corpora and discuss practical issues in the application of forced alignment. Our evaluation shows that (Web)MAUS with its existing acoustic models combined with simple grapheme-to-phoneme conversion can be successfully used for word-level forced alignment of a diverse set of languages without additional training, especially if a manual prealignment of larger annotation units is already avaible."><td>12</td><td>Untrained Forced Alignment of Transcriptions and Audio for Language Documentation Corpora using WebMAUS</td><td>0.529</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper argues for the usefulness of multimodal spoken language corpora and specifies components of a platform for the creation, maintenance and exploitation of such corpora.

In this paper, we propose a model that uses finer-grained visual information from different parts of the image, using automatic object proposals. In experiments on the Flickr8K Audio Captions Corpus, we find that our model improves over approaches that use global visual features, that the proposals enable the model to recover entities and other related words, such as adjectives, and that improvements are due to the model's ability to localize the correct proposals. 1"><td>14</td><td>Fine-Grained Grounding for Multimodal Speech Recognition</td><td>0.534</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Recent years' most efficient approaches for language understanding are statistical.

Our work consists in segmenting and aligning transcriptions with respect to reports, to get a suitable dataset for neural summarization. Using a bootstrapping approach, we provide pre-alignments that are corrected by human annotators, making a validation set against which we evaluate automatic models. This consistently reduces annotators' efforts by providing iteratively better pre-alignment and maximizes the corpus size by using annotations from our automatic alignment models.

Because these corpora contain both precisely transcribed regions and edited regions, it is difficult to use them directly as speech corpora for learning acoustic models. Under this background, we have been considering to build an efficient semi-automatic framework to convert loose transcriptions to precise ones. This paper describes an improved automatic detection method of precise regions from loosely transcribed corpora for the above framework. Our detection method consists of two steps: the first step is a force alignment between loose transcriptions and their utterances to discover the corresponding utterance for the certain loose transcription, and the second step is a detector of precise regions with a support vector machine using several features obtained from the first step. Our experimental result shows that our method achieves a high accuracy of detecting precise regions, and shows that the precise regions extracted by our method are effective as training labels of lightly supervised speaker adaptation."><td>20</td><td>Developing Partially-Transcribed Speech Corpus from Edited Transcriptions</td><td>0.542</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Phonetic segmentation is the process of splitting speech into distinct phonetic units.

Even though laboratory experiments on speech are controlled to a certain extent (e.g., minimal word pairs, short sentences, read speech) and are usually annotated manually, the increasing trend to analyze spontaneous speech, especially in human-machine interaction, requires tools to facilitate semi-automatic annotation tasks with a compact visualization for manual revision, presentation of results and versatile scripting capabilities.The Praat software (Boersma, 2001) is one of the most widely used open-source tools for audio signal processing and annotation in the speech community. Praat has a dedicated text format called TextGrid, where stackable lines, called tiers, are mapped to the whole time-stamp of the associated sound file (cf.Figure 1). Accordingly, tiers account for the temporal nature of speech and take one compulsory parameter: the time-stamp of the segments, which are the smallest unit in a TextGrid. A time-stamp can be of two kinds: an interval (specifying the beginning and end time of each segment) or a point in time. This sequence of time-stamps is encoded in tiers as consecutive segments. Once (interval or point) segments are marked, they can take an optional string parameter, called label.While suitable for a coarse-grained glance at the acoustic profile of speech, Praat shows two major limitations when it comes to more detailed annotation that also involves linguistic information. Firstly, Praat's segment annotations are opaque blocks of strings, and there is no function for a linguistic analysis of the labels. For instance, if an interval segment for the word places (as in the example shown inFigure  1) includes morphological information within the same label (e.g., &quot;places: noun = plural&quot;), there is no function in Praat that would allow the division of the string places: noun = plural into tokens of any kind, for example, places -noun -plural . Secondly, Praat is not modular, i.e., all automatic routines a user is interested in (e.g., detection of silent and voiced parts, annotation of intensity peaks and valleys, computing relative values, etc.) must be programmed together in a single script. No user need-driven composition of stand-alone off-the-shelf scripts for dedicated subroutines is possible, which implies that for any new constellation of the subroutines a new script must be programmed.

Firstly, a generic standard Arabic AM is used along with the biased LM and the graphemic PM in a fast speech recognition pass. In a second pass, a more restricted LM is generated for each audio segment, and unsupervised acoustic model adaptation is applied. The recognizer output is aligned with the processed transcriptions using Levenshtein algorithm. The proposed approach resulted in an initial alignment accuracy of 97.8-99.0% depending on the amount of disfluencies. A confidence scoring metric is proposed to accept/reject aligner output.

Our methodological considerations addressed the following: which ASR tool to use, how to prepare training data for this tool, and how to best manage the bias of the training data inherent in all transcription processes.We chose the Elpis ASR system, which combines user-friendly data processing scripts with a Kaldi HMM/GMM (Hidden Markov Model/Gaussian Mixture Model) recipe. Elpis generates transcripts as time-aligned ELAN files, which was a good fit with the broader project investigating Indonesian language teaching.A team of transcribers established guidelines which reflexively responded to a range of methodological considerations. Indonesian diglossic variants exist in a highly diverse linguistic ecosystem(Djenar and Ewing, 2015;Sneddon, 2003;Goebel, 2010). This was highlighted by transcriber subjectivity in the teaching context. For example, the task of analyzing and choosing orthography to transcribe teacher speech into over-simplified, binary L1 versus L2 categories (1st language: English, 2nd language: Indonesian) is influenced by transcriber expectations of language norms in 'high' vs. 'low' varieties of Indonesian. Further, the goal of modifying sociolinguistic norms which brings people to language classrooms precipitated a level of variance and unpredictability unusual in other speech contexts as teachers respond to student acquisition processes. We also provided examples of the development of a Community of Practice (Wenger, 1998) as another layer of complexity in the group classroom environment.The dataset was transcribed using several &quot;tiers&quot; to create parallel structures for storing data. While predominately working from a code-switching paradigm, the data structure allowed us to train multiple models for comparative evaluation. We trained three models, two of which included all training data and multi-lingual pronunciation lexicons, resonating with work on translanguaging in educational settings (Garcia and Wei, 2014). The third model was trained with Indonesian data only. Our preliminary result of 64% word error rate (WER) is high in comparison to mono-lingual ASR systems(Maxwelll-Smith et al., 2020). However, WERs from code-switch bilingual data(Biswas et al., 2019)were more similar to our WER, especially given our small amount of training data.By analysing the text spans in the machine transcription, we found a high incidence of resyllabification (word splitting), particularly with omission of initial or middle consonants. The analysis identified which model would include less disruptive errors than the others, and which would be more responsive to the addition of further training data.The application of ASR tools is limited in this setting given the small set of training data, however using these tools has potential to expedite the transcription of teacher corpora. These tools could change workflow and decrease cognitive load for human transcribers by generating a draft transcript for revision. We highlight some of the benefits and risks of using these emerging technologies to analyze the complex work of language teachers, and in education more generally.132"><td>94</td><td>Developing ASR for Indonesian-English Bilingual Language Teaching</td><td>0.585</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper describes the evaluation methodology followed to measure the impact of using a machine learning algorithm to automatically segment intralingual subtitles.

The aligner implements a recurrent architecture for structural prediction using history features and a sequential classification procedure. The discriminative base classifier uses a log-linear model which enables simple integration of various features extracted from the data. The Lingua-Align toolbox provides a flexible framework for feature extraction including contextual properties and implements several alignment inference procedures. Various settings and constraints can be controlled via a simple frontend or called from external scripts. Lingua-Align supports different treebank formats and includes additional tools for conversion and evaluation. In our experiments we can show that our tree aligner produces results with high quality and outperforms unsupervised techniques proposed otherwise. It also integrates well with another existing tool for manual tree alignment which makes it possible to quickly integrate additional training material and to run semi-automatic alignment strategies."><td>96</td><td>Lingua-Align: An Experimental Toolbox for Automatic Tree-to-Tree Alignment</td><td>0.586</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper presents a plugin that adds automatic speech recognition (ASR) functionality to the WaveSurfer sound manipulation and visualisation program.
