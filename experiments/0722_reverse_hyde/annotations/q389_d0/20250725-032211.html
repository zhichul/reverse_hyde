However for translation, CTC exhibits clear limitations due to the contextual and non-monotonic nature of the task and thus lags behind attentional decoder approaches in terms of translation quality. In this work, we argue that CTC does in fact make sense for translation if applied in a joint CTC/attention framework wherein CTC's core properties can counteract several key weaknesses of pure-attention models during training and decoding. To validate this conjecture, we modify the Hybrid CTC/Attention model originally proposed for ASR to support text-to-text translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (ST). Our proposed joint CTC/attention models outperform pure-attention baselines across six benchmark translation tasks."><td>1</td><td>CTC Alignments Improve Autoregressive Translation</td><td>0.490</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Non-autoregressive encoder-decoder models greatly improve decoding speed over autoregressive models, at the expense of generation quality. To mitigate this, iterative decoding models repeatedly infill or refine the proposal of a non-autoregressive model. However, editing at the level of output sequences limits model flexibility. We instead propose iterative realignment, which by refining latent alignments allows more flexible edits in fewer steps. Our model, Align-Refine, is an end-to-end Transformer which iteratively realigns connectionist temporal classification (CTC) alignments. On the WSJ dataset, Align-Refine matches an autoregressive baseline with a 14× decoding speedup; on LibriSpeech, we reach an LM-free testother WER of 9.0% (19% relative improvement on comparable work) in three iterations. We release our code at https://github.com/ amazon-research/align-refine."><td>2</td><td>Align-Refine: Non-Autoregressive Speech Recognition via Iterative Realignment</td><td>0.492</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Learning multilingual representations of text has proven a successful method for many cross-lingual transfer learning tasks. There are two main paradigms for learning such representations: (1) alignment, which maps different independently trained monolingual representations into a shared space, and (2) joint training, which directly learns unified multilingual representations using monolingual and cross-lingual objectives jointly. In this paper, we first conduct direct comparisons of representations learned using both of these methods across diverse crosslingual tasks. Our empirical results reveal a set of pros and cons for both methods, and show that the relative performance of alignment versus joint training is taskdependent. Stemming from this analysis, we propose a simple and novel framework that combines these two previously mutually-exclusive approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework alleviates limitations of both approaches, and outperforms existing methods on the MUSE bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) benchmark. We further show that this framework can generalize to contextualized representations such as Multilingual BERT, and produces state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL cross-lingual NER benchmark. 1 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020The joint vocabulary is composed of three disjoint sets:is the shared vocabulary set and V i J is the set of tokens that appear in the ith language only. Note that a key difference of existing supervised joint training methods is that embeddings corresponding to V s J are not shared between E L1 and E L2 , meaning that they are disjoint, as in alignment methods.DISCUSSIONWhile alignment methods have had great success, there are still some critical downsides, among which we stress the following points:"><td>3</td><td>CROSS-LINGUAL ALIGNMENT VS JOINT TRAINING: A COMPARATIVE STUDY AND A SIMPLE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK</td><td>0.501</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Training objectives based on predictive coding have recently been shown to be very effective at learning meaningful representations from unlabeled speech. One example is Autoregressive Predictive Coding (Chung et al., 2019), which trains an autoregressive RNN to generate an unseen future frame given a context such as recent past frames. The basic hypothesis of these approaches is that hidden states that can accurately predict future frames are a useful representation for many downstream tasks. In this paper we extend this hypothesis and aim to enrich the information encoded in the hidden states by training the model to make more accurate future predictions. We propose an auxiliary objective that serves as a regularization to improve generalization of the future frame prediction task. Experimental results on phonetic classification, speech recognition, and speech translation not only support the hypothesis, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning representations that contain richer phonetic content."><td>4</td><td>Improved Speech Representations with Multi-Target Autoregressive Predictive Coding</td><td>0.505</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Pretraining and multitask learning are widely used to improve the speech to text translation performance. In this study, we are interested in training a speech to text translation model along with an auxiliary text to text translation task. We conduct a detailed analysis to understand the impact of the auxiliary task on the primary task within the multitask learning framework. Our analysis confirms that multitask learning tends to generate similar decoder representations from different modalities and preserve more information from the pretrained text translation modules. We observe minimal negative transfer effect between the two tasks and sharing more parameters is helpful to transfer knowledge from the text task to the speech task. The analysis also reveals that the modality representation difference at the top decoder layers is still not negligible, and those layers are critical for the translation quality. Inspired by these findings, we propose three methods to improve translation quality. First, a parameter sharing and initialization strategy is proposed to enhance information sharing between the tasks. Second, a novel attention-based regularization is proposed for the encoders and pulls the representations from different modalities closer. Third, an online knowledge distillation is proposed to enhance the knowledge transfer from the text to the speech task. Our experiments show that the proposed approach improves translation performance by more than 2 BLEU over a strong baseline and achieves state-of-theart results on the MUST-C English-German, English-French and English-Spanish language pairs."><td>5</td><td>Improving Speech Translation by Understanding and Learning from the Auxiliary Text Translation Task</td><td>0.512</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The rapid development of single-modal pretraining has prompted researchers to pay more attention to cross-modal pre-training methods. In this paper, we propose a unified-modal speech-unit-text pre-training model, SpeechUT, to connect the representations of a speech encoder and a text decoder with a shared unit encoder. Leveraging hidden-unit as an interface to align speech and text, we can decompose the speech-to-text model into a speech-to-unit model and a unit-to-text model, which can be jointly pre-trained with unpaired speech and text data respectively. Our proposed SpeechUT is fine-tuned and evaluated on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) tasks. Experimental results show that SpeechUT gets substantial improvements over strong baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the Lib-riSpeech ASR and MuST-C ST tasks. To better understand the proposed SpeechUT, detailed analyses are conducted.

The proposed method incorporates four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning.A self-supervised speech subtask leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask makes use of abundant text training data. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Our contribution lies in integrating linguistic information from the text corpus into the speech pre-training. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. Two pre-training configurations for speech translation and recognition, respectively, are presented to alleviate subtask interference. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It achieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the MUST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the LIBRISPEECH speech recognition task. 1"><td>7</td><td>Unified Speech-Text Pre-training for Speech Translation and Recognition</td><td>0.518</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Recent work has begun exploring neural acoustic word embeddings-fixeddimensional vector representations of arbitrary-length speech segments corresponding to words. Such embeddings are applicable to speech retrieval and recognition tasks, where reasoning about whole words may make it possible to avoid ambiguous sub-word representations. The main idea is to map acoustic sequences to fixed-dimensional vectors such that examples of the same word are mapped to similar vectors, while different-word examples are mapped to very different vectors. In this work we take a multi-view approach to learning acoustic word embeddings, in which we jointly learn to embed acoustic sequences and their corresponding character sequences. We use deep bidirectional LSTM embedding models and multi-view contrastive losses. We study the effect of different loss variants, including fixed-margin and cost-sensitive losses. Our acoustic word embeddings improve over previous approaches for the task of word discrimination. We also present results on other tasks that are enabled by the multi-view approach, including cross-view word discrimination and word similarity.One of the useful properties of this multi-view approach is that, unlike earlier work on acoustic word embeddings, it produces both acoustic and orthographic embeddings that can be directly compared. This makes it possible to use the same learned embeddings for multiple single-view and cross-view tasks. Our multi-view embeddings produce improved results over earlier work on acoustic word discrimination, as well as encouraging results on cross-view discrimination and word similarity. 1"><td>8</td><td>MULTI-VIEW RECURRENT NEURAL ACOUSTIC WORD EMBEDDINGS</td><td>0.528</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Recently, speech-text pre-training methods have shown remarkable success in many speech and natural language processing tasks. However, most previous pre-trained models are usually tailored for one or two specific tasks, but fail to conquer a wide range of speech-text tasks. In addition, existing speech-text pretraining methods fail to explore the contextual information within a dialogue to enrich utterance representations. In this paper, we propose Speech-text dialog Pre-training for spoken dialog understanding with ExpliCiT cRoss-Modal Alignment (SPECTRA), which is the first-ever speech-text dialog pre-training model. Concretely, to consider the temporality of speech modality, we design a novel temporal position prediction task to capture the speech-text alignment. This pre-training task aims to predict the start and end time of each textual word in the corresponding speech waveform. In addition, to learn the characteristics of spoken dialogs, we generalize a response selection task from textual dialog pre-training to speech-text dialog pre-training scenarios. Experimental results on four different downstream speech-text tasks demonstrate the superiority of SPECTRA in learning speech-text alignment and multi-turn dialog context. 1"><td>9</td><td>Speech-Text Dialog Pre-training for Spoken Dialog Understanding with Explicit Cross-Modal Alignment</td><td>0.530</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="For many low-resource languages, spoken language resources are more likely to be annotated with translations than transcriptions. This bilingual speech data can be used for word-spotting, spoken document retrieval, and even for documentation of endangered languages. We experiment with the neural, attentional model applied to this data. On phoneto-word alignment and translation reranking tasks, we achieve large improvements relative to several baselines. On the more challenging speech-to-word alignment task, our model nearly matches GIZA++'s performance on gold transcriptions, but without recourse to transcriptions or to a lexicon."><td>10</td><td>An Attentional Model for Speech Translation Without Transcription</td><td>0.533</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper investigates two latent alignment models for non-autoregressive machine translation, namely CTC and Imputer. CTC generates outputs in a single step, makes strong conditional independence assumptions about output variables, and marginalizes out latent alignments using dynamic programming. Imputer generates outputs in a constant number of steps, and approximately marginalizes out possible generation orders and latent alignments for training. These models are simpler than existing non-autoregressive methods, since they do not require output length prediction as a pre-process. In addition, our architecture is simpler than typical encoder-decoder architectures, since input-output cross attention is not used. On the competitive WMT'14 En→De task, our CTC model achieves 25.7 BLEU with a single generation step, while Imputer achieves 27.5 BLEU with 2 generation steps, and 28.0 BLEU with 4 generation steps. This compares favourably to the baseline autoregressive Transformer with 27.8 BLEU."><td>11</td><td>Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation with Latent Alignments</td><td>0.534</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019,  mBERT), XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al.,  2019, XLMR)  and other unsupervised multilingual encoders can effectively learn crosslingual representation. Explicit alignment objectives based on bitexts like Europarl or Mul-tiUN have been shown to further improve these representations. However, word-level alignments are often suboptimal and such bitexts are unavailable for many languages. In this paper, we propose a new contrastive alignment objective that can better utilize such signal, and examine whether these previous alignment methods can be adapted to noisier sources of aligned data: a randomly sampled 1 million pair subset of the OPUS collection. Additionally, rather than report results on a single dataset with a single model run, we report the mean and standard derivation of multiple runs with different seeds, on four datasets and tasks. Our more extensive analysis finds that, while our new objective outperforms previous work, overall these methods do not improve performance with a more robust evaluation framework. Furthermore, the gains from using a better underlying model eclipse any benefits from alignment training. These negative results dictate more care in evaluating these methods and suggest limitations in applying explicit alignment objectives. Sennrich. 2020.

To boost the models' performance, various pre-training methods have been proposed to learn rich representations from large-scale unannotated speech and text. However, the inherent disparities between the two modalities necessitate a mutual analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel semisupervised learning framework, SPLAT, to jointly pre-train the speech and language modules. Besides conducting a self-supervised masked language modeling task on the two individual modules using unpaired speech and text, SPLAT aligns representations from the two modules in a shared latent space using a small amount of paired speech and text. Thus, during fine-tuning, the speech module alone can produce representations carrying both acoustic information and contextual semantic knowledge of an input acoustic signal. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach on various SLU tasks.

We evaluate ConST and a variety of previous baselines on a popular benchmark MuST-C. Experiments show that the proposed ConST consistently outperforms the previous methods, and achieves an average BLEU of 29.4. The analysis further verifies that ConST indeed closes the representation gap of different modalities -its learned representation improves the accuracy of cross-modal speechtext retrieval from 4% to 88%.

We propose to use multitask learning to exploit existing transcribed speech within the end-to-end setting. We describe a three-task architecture which combines the objectives of matching spoken captions with corresponding images, speech with text, and text with images. We show that the addition of the SPEECH/TEXT task leads to substantial performance improvements on image retrieval when compared to training the SPEECH/IMAGE task in isolation.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for non-autoregressive speech translation (NAST). In particular, we develop a model consisting of two encoders that are guided by CTC to predict the source and target texts, respectively. Introducing CTC into NAST on both language sides has obvious challenges: 1) the conditional independent generation somewhat breaks the interdependency among tokens, and 2) the monotonic alignment assumption in standard CTC does not hold in translation tasks. In response, we develop a prediction-aware encoding approach and a cross-layer attention approach to address these issues. We also use curriculum learning to improve convergence of training.

The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved performance-latency trade-off for online models.

However, FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated and time-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification, both of which limit the voice quality.

FastSpeech designs two ways to alleviate the one-to-many mapping problem: 1) Reducing data variance in the target side by using the generated mel-spectrogram from an autoregressive teacher model as the training target (i.e., knowledge distillation). 2) Introducing the duration information (extracted from the attention map of the teacher model) to expand the text sequence to match the length of the mel-spectrogram sequence. While these designs in FastSpeech ease the learning of the one-to-many mapping problem (see Section 2.1) in TTS, they also bring several disadvantages: 1) The two-stage teacher-student training pipeline makes the training process complicated.2) The target mel-spectrograms generated from the teacher model have some information loss 1 compared with the ground-truth ones, since the quality of the audio synthesized from the generated mel-spectrograms is usually worse than that from the ground-truth ones.3) The duration extracted from the attention map of teacher model is not accurate enough."><td>39</td><td>FASTSPEECH 2: FAST AND HIGH-QUALITY END-TO- END TEXT TO SPEECH</td><td>0.553</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This work proposes a new confidence measure for evaluating text-to-speech alignment systems outputs, which is a key component for many applications, such as semi-automatic corpus anonymization, lips syncing, film dubbing, corpus preparation for speech synthesis and speech recognition acoustic models training.

To remedy this problem, we propose Cross-Align to model deep interactions between the input sentence pairs, in which the source and target sentences are encoded separately with the shared self-attention modules in the shallow layers, while cross-lingual interactions are explicitly constructed by the crossattention modules in the upper layers. Besides, to train our model effectively, we propose a two-stage training framework, where the model is trained with a simple Translation Language Modeling (TLM) objective in the first stage and then finetuned with a self-supervised alignment objective in the second stage.

However, CBOW is not capable of capturing the word order. The reason is that the computation of CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ and ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a learning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model (Rudolph &amp; Giesbrecht, 2010), which we call Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is an adaptation of word2vec(Mikolov et al., 2013a), so that it can be trained on large quantities of unlabeled text. We empirically show that CMOW better captures linguistic properties, but it is inferior to CBOW in memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we propose a hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong ability to memorize word content while at the same time substantially improving its ability to encode other linguistic information by 8%. As a result, the hybrid also performs better on 8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average improvement of 1.2%.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2019 ability to encode word order.

However, fundamental challenges such as error propagation from the automatic speech recognition system still remain. To mitigate these problems, recently, people turn their attention to direct data and propose various joint training methods. In this work, we seek to answer the question of whether joint training really helps cascaded speech translation. We review recent papers on the topic and also investigate a joint training criterion by marginalizing the transcription posterior probabilities. Our findings show that a strong cascaded baseline can diminish any improvements obtained using joint training, and we suggest alternatives to joint training. We hope this work can serve as a refresher of the current speech translation landscape, and motivate research in finding more efficient and creative ways to utilize the direct data for speech translation."><td>86</td><td>Does Joint Training Really Help Cascaded Speech Translation?</td><td>0.572</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper describes FBK's participation in the IWSLT 2020 offline speech translation (ST) task.

Participants can decide whether to work on custom segmentation or not. We used the provided segmentation. Our system is an endto-end model based on an adaptation of the Transformer for speech data. Its training process is the main focus of this paper and it is based on: i) transfer learning (ASR pretraining and knowledge distillation), ii) data augmentation (SpecAugment, time stretch and synthetic data), iii) combining synthetic and real data marked as different domains, and iv) multitask learning using the CTC loss. Finally, after the training with word-level knowledge distillation is complete, our ST models are finetuned using label smoothed cross entropy.

The choice of these tokens and the decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens is often static, and independent of the input, output data domains. This can potentially lead to a sub-optimal choice of token dictionaries, as the decomposition is not informed by the particular problem being solved. In this paper we present Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD), a framework in which the decomposition of sequences into constituent tokens is learnt during the training of the model. The decomposition depends both on the input sequence and on the output sequence. In LSD, during training, the model samples decompositions incrementally, from left to right by locally sampling between valid extensions. We experiment with the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task. Our LSD model achieves 12.9% WER compared to a character baseline of 14.8% WER.

We greatly improved the word alignment accuracy by adding the context of the token to the question. In the experiments using five word alignment datasets among Chinese, Japanese, German, Romanian, French, and English, we show that the proposed method significantly outperformed previous supervised and unsupervised word alignment methods without using any bitexts for pretraining.

Additionally, we incorporate a multitask training criterion for multiresolution ASR, where we train the model to generate both character and subword level transcriptions. Experimental results on the How2 dataset, indicate that multiresolution training can speed up convergence by around 50% and relatively improves word error rate (WER) performance by upto 18% over subword prediction models.

Recently, it has been shown that these embeddings can be effectively learned by aligning two disjoint monolingual vector spaces through linear transformations, using no more than a small bilingual dictionary as supervision. In this work, we propose to apply an additional transformation after the initial alignment step, which moves cross-lingual synonyms towards a middle point between them. By applying this transformation our aim is to obtain a better cross-lingual integration of the vector spaces. In addition, and perhaps surprisingly, the monolingual spaces also improve by this transformation. This is in contrast to the original alignment, which is typically learned such that the structure of the monolingual spaces is preserved. Our experiments confirm that the resulting cross-lingual embeddings outperform state-of-the-art models in both monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation tasks."><td>95</td><td>Improving Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings by Meeting in the Middle</td><td>0.576</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Most word embeddings today are trained by optimizing a language modeling goal of scoring words in their context, modeled as a multiclass classification problem. Despite the successes of this assumption, it is incomplete: in addition to its context, orthographical or morphological aspects of words can offer clues about their meaning. In this paper, we define a new modeling framework for training word embeddings that captures this intuition. Our framework is based on the well-studied problem of multi-label classification and, consequently, exposes several design choices for featurizing words and contexts, loss functions for training and score normalization. Indeed, standard models such as CBOW and FAST-TEXT are specific choices along each of these axes. We show via experiments that by combining feature engineering with embedding learning, our method can outperform CBOW using only 10% of the training data in both the standard word embedding evaluations and also text classification experiments."><td>96</td><td>Beyond Context: A New Perspective for Word Embeddings</td><td>0.577</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We consider the problem of aligning continuous word representations, learned in multiple languages, to a common space.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.
