By the very nature of Egyptian Arabic, the data collected is informal, for example Discussion Forum text, which we use for the treebank discussed here. In addition, Egyptian Arabic, like other Arabic dialects, is sufficiently different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that tools and techniques developed for MSA cannot be simply transferred over to work on Egyptian Arabic work. In particular, a morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic is needed to mediate between the written text and the segmented, vocalized form used for the syntactic trees. This led to the necessity of a feedback loop between the treebank team and the analyzer team, as improvements in each area were fed to the other. Therefore, by necessity, there needed to be close cooperation between the annotation team and the tool development team, which was to their mutual benefit. Collaboration on this type of challenge, where tools and resources are limited, proved to be remarkably synergistic and opens the way to further fruitful work on Arabic dialects."><td>8</td><td>Developing an Egyptian Arabic Treebank: Impact of Dialectal Morphology on Annotation and Tool Development</td><td>0.460</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="(no abstract)"><td>9</td><td>Building a Shallow Arabic Morphological Analyzer in One Day</td><td>0.463</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="The many differences between Dialectal Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) pose a challenge to the majority of Arabic natural language processing tools, which are designed for MSA.

Each annotated word is associated with its suitable prefix(s), original stem, tag, suffix(s), glossary, number, gender, definiteness, and conventional lemma and stem.

For example, annotators are provided with pre-computed analyses to assist them in their task and reduce the amount of work needed to complete it. MADARi also allows annotators to query a morphological analyzer for a list of possible analyses in multiple dialects or look up previously submitted analyses.

The challenging nature of noisy text processing is exacerbated for dialectal content, where in addition to spelling and lexical differences, dialectal text is characterized with morpho-syntactic and phonetic variations. These issues increase sparsity in NLP models and reduce accuracy. We present a neural morphological tagging and disambiguation model for Egyptian Arabic, with various extensions to handle noisy and inconsistent content. Our models achieve about 5% relative error reduction (1.1% absolute improvement) for full morphological analysis, and around 22% relative error reduction (1.8% absolute improvement) for part-of-speech tagging, over a state-of-the-art baseline."><td>17</td><td>Noise-Robust Morphological Disambiguation for Dialectal Arabic</td><td>0.499</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Arabic is a Semitic language which is widely spoken with many dialects.

We probe how linguistic information is encoded in the transformer models, trained on different Arabic dialects. We perform a layer and neuron analysis on the models using morphological tagging tasks for different dialects of Arabic and a dialectal identification task. Our analysis enlightens interesting findings such as: i) word morphology is learned at the lower and middle layers, ii) while syntactic dependencies are predominantly captured at the higher layers, iii) despite a large overlap in their vocabulary, the MSA-based models fail to capture the nuances of Arabic dialects, iv) we found that neurons in embedding layers are polysemous in nature, while the neurons in middle layers are exclusive to specific properties."><td>18</td><td>Post-hoc analysis of Arabic transformer models</td><td>0.506</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present the second ever evaluated Arabic dialect-to-dialect machine translation effort, and the first to leverage external resources beyond a small parallel corpus. The subject has not previously received serious attention due to lack of naturally occurring parallel data; yet its importance is evidenced by dialectal Arabic's wide usage and breadth of inter-dialect variation, comparable to that of Romance languages. Our results suggest that modeling morphology and syntax significantly improves dialect-to-dialect translation, though optimizing such data-sparse models requires consideration of the linguistic differences between dialects and the nature of available data and resources. On a single-reference blind test set where untranslated input scores 6.5 BLEU and a model trained only on parallel data reaches 14.6, pivot techniques and morphosyntactic modeling significantly improve performance to 17.5.Arabic is widely spoken and highly diglossic, with Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) representing the high register shared across the Arab World in educated circles. In contrast, the many spoken dialectal Arabic varieties (DA) are somewhat if not entirely mutually unintelligible, e.g., Moroccan and Kuwaiti. Chiang et al. (2006)  compare the linguistic variation among Arabic dialects to that among Romance languages, indicating the need for machine translation (MT) between these dialects. However, while much MT research has been devoted to translating between Romance languages(Corbí Bellot et al., 2005;Armentano-Oller et al., 2006;Koehn et al., 2009), we are aware of only one work on Arabic DA-to-DA MT(Meftouh et al., 2015). It deals mainly with Maghrebi dialects and utilizes only a small parallel corpus. 1 This work focuses on the Egyptian and Levantine dialects, leveraging various available resources such as a morphological analyzer and additional monolingual and multilingual data. 2 Compared to other dialects, Egyptian and Levantine's wider range of available data/resources allows us to evaluate more MT approaches using different combinations of these data/resources. Thus, in future work on DA pairs which may not have the same data/resources, we can tailor MT systems based on this paper's findings.The main challenge in developing DA-to-DA MT systems is the lack of data. While many Romance languages are official languages with written standards, naturally occurring in parallel corpora like the European Parliament(Koehn, 2005), DA has no official status and was rarely written until the advent of social media. 3  The recent release of the first parallel multi-dialectal corpora(Bouamor et al., 2014;Meftouh et al., 2015)has enabled seminal, albeit low-resource MT experiments. We present some shortcomings of these corpora and introduce an in-house, under-development corpus. Then we explore different means of leveraging external resources, e.g., Egyptian-to-English and Levantine-to-English data and an Egyptian tokenizer and morphological analyzer(Habash et al., 2012b;Maamouri et al., 2014;Pasha et al., 2014). We conduct experiments in a range of data-sparse settings and show the effect of morpho-syntactic features on the DA-to-DA MT performance. Our approach can be extended to other DA pairs and other closely related languages and dialects(Tyers et al., 2017).Related WorkAn increasing amount of research has been conducted on dialectal Arabic NLP; however, most dialectal MT efforts translate from DA to MSA or English. The only other DA-to-DA work we are aware of focuses on manipulating language model smoothing parameters to optimize data sparse MT performance(Meftouh et al., 2015).Dialectal Arabic Machine TranslationWhile onlyMeftouh et al. (2015)have evaluated DA-to-DA MT, many others have addressed MT between DA and other languages.Zbib et al. (2012)attempted to translate from Egyptian and Levantine to English and found that pivoting through better resourced MSA was not useful due to register and domain differences. MSA, the higher register, is rarely used to discuss the day-to-day matters frequently treated with DA, causing a domain mismatch. However, several approaches have since presented alternative results(Sawaf, 2010;Habash, 2011,  2012;Sajjad et al., 2013;Durrani et al., 2014). These use rule-based or hybrid methods to identify mappings from DA to MSA before translating to a target language (usually English). Additionally, Tachicart and Bouzoubaa (2014) report results on adapting an approach designed for MSA to Moroccan translation to translate in the inverse direction (Moroccan to MSA).Dialectal Arabic DataSeveral newly developed corpora have facilitated the recent surge in dialectal NLP work.1 Maghrebi dialects are those spoken in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. 2 Levantine covers the dialects spoken in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan. 3  Recently, two parallel Arabic translations were created for 12,000 sentences from the European Parliamentary proceedings, but both are in MSA (Habash et al., 2017)."><td>19</td><td>Low Resourced Machine Translation via Morpho-syntactic Modeling: The Case of Dialectal Arabic</td><td>0.506</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="This paper presents a wide literature review of natural language processing for dialectical Arabic.
