Recent methods with stochastic gradient learning have been shown to struggle in such setups or have limitations like memory buffers, and being restricted to specific domains that disable its usage in realworld scenarios. For this reason, we present a fully differentiable architecture based on the Mixture of Experts model, that enables the training of high-performance classifiers when examples from each class are presented separately. We conducted exhaustive experiments that proved its applicability in various domains and ability to learn online in production environments.

Inspired by both recent results on neural networks with wide local minima and information theory, CPR adds an additional regularization term that maximizes the entropy of a classifier's output probability. We demonstrate that this additional term can be interpreted as a projection of the conditional probability given by a classifier's output to the uniform distribution. By applying the Pythagorean theorem for KL divergence, we then prove that this projection may (in theory) improve the performance of continual learning methods. In our extensive experimental results, we apply CPR to several state-of-the-art regularization-based continual learning methods and benchmark performance on popular image recognition datasets. Our results demonstrate that CPR indeed promotes a wide local minima and significantly improves both accuracy and plasticity while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting of baseline continual learning methods.Preprint.

Experience Replay (ER), where a small subset of past data is stored and replayed alongside new data, has emerged as a simple and effective learning strategy. In this work, we focus on the change in representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be distinguished from previous ones. We shed new light on this question by showing that applying ER causes the newly added classes' representations to overlap significantly with the previous classes, leading to highly disruptive parameter updates. Based on this empirical analysis, we propose a new method which mitigates this issue by shielding the learned representations from drastic adaptation to accommodate new classes. We show that using an asymmetric update rule pushes new classes to adapt to the older ones (rather than the reverse), which is more effective especially at task boundaries, where much of the forgetting typically occurs.

In this work we propose a new conceptualization of the continual learning problem in terms of a temporally symmetric trade-off between transfer and interference that can be optimized by enforcing gradient alignment across examples. We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. 1  We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.1"><td>4</td><td>LEARNING TO LEARN WITHOUT FORGETTING BY MAXIMIZING TRANSFER AND MINIMIZING INTERFERENCE</td><td>0.461</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Despite rapid advances in continual learning, a large body of research is devoted to improving performance in the existing setups.

Existing approaches to the problem rely on complex model architectures and training procedures that are difficult to tune and re-use. In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of subspace regularization schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 22% on the miniImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); these further improve accuracy by up to 2%. Our results show that simple geometric regularization of class representations offers an effective tool for continual learning. 1 1 Code for the experiments is released under https://github.com/feyzaakyurek/subspace-reg."><td>6</td><td>SUBSPACE REGULARIZERS FOR FEW-SHOT CLASS INCREMENTAL LEARNING</td><td>0.467</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Humans excel at continually learning from an ever-changing environment whereas it remains a challenge for deep neural networks which exhibit catastrophic forgetting.

Our method employs an effective replay mechanism whereby new knowledge is acquired while aligning the decision boundaries with the semantic memories. CLS-ER does not utilize the task boundaries or make any assumption about the distribution of the data which makes it versatile and suited for &quot;general continual learning&quot;.

The loss function for the reconstructed images is weighted to reduce its effect during classifier training to cope with image degradation. When the system runs out of memory the encoded episodes are converted into centroids and covariance matrices, which are used to generate pseudo-images during classifier training, keeping classifier performance stable while using less memory.

This violates the assumptions that underlie methods for training standard deep neural networks, and will cause them to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Arguably, the best method for incremental class learning is iCaRL, but it requires storing training examples for each class, making it challenging to scale. Here, we propose FearNet for incremental class learning. Fear-Net is a generative model that does not store previous examples, making it memory efficient. FearNet uses a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex. Memory consolidation is inspired by mechanisms that occur during sleep. FearNet also uses a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall. FearNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at incremental class learning on image (CIFAR-100, CUB-200) and audio classification (AudioSet) benchmarks."><td>9</td><td>FEARNET: BRAIN-INSPIRED MODEL FOR INCREMENTAL LEARNING</td><td>0.486</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Continual learning aims to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. This is especially challenging when one cannot access data from previous tasks and when the model has a fixed capacity. Current regularization-based continual learning algorithms need an external representation and extra computation to measure the parameters' importance. In contrast, we propose Uncertaintyguided Continual Bayesian Neural Networks (UCB), where the learning rate adapts according to the uncertainty defined in the probability distribution of the weights in networks. Uncertainty is a natural way to identify what to remember and what to change as we continually learn, and thus mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We also show a variant of our model, which uses uncertainty for weight pruning and retains task performance after pruning by saving binary masks per tasks. We evaluate our UCB approach extensively on diverse object classification datasets with short and long sequences of tasks and report superior or on-par performance compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we show that our model does not necessarily need task information at test time, i.e. it does not presume knowledge of which task a sample belongs to."><td>10</td><td>UNCERTAINTY-GUIDED CONTINUAL LEARNING WITH BAYESIAN NEURAL NETWORKS</td><td>0.489</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Intelligent systems deployed in the real world suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to a sequence of tasks. Humans, on the other hand, acquire, consolidate, and transfer knowledge between tasks that rarely interfere with the consolidated knowledge. Accompanied by self-regulated neurogenesis, continual learning in the brain is governed by a rich set of neurophysiological processes that harbor different types of knowledge, which are then integrated by conscious processing. Thus, inspired by the Global Workspace Theory of conscious information access in the brain, we propose TAMiL, a continual learning method that entails task-attention modules to capture task-specific information from the common representation space. We employ simple, undercomplete autoencoders to create a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace, allowing only the task-relevant information to the global workspace, thus greatly reducing task interference. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art rehearsal-based and dynamic sparse approaches and bridges the gap between fixed capacity and parameter isolation approaches while being scalable. We also show that our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while being well-calibrated with reduced taskrecency bias 1 .Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 common representation space of fixed capacity from which information is selected, maintained, and shared with the rest of the brain. When addressing the current task, the attention mechanism creates a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace and admits only relevant information in the global workspace (Goyal &amp; Bengio, 2020). Such a system enables efficient CL in humans with systematic generalization across tasks(Bengio, 2017).Several approaches have been proposed in the literature that mimic one or more neurophysiological processes in the brain to address catastrophic forgetting in DNN. Experience rehearsal (Ratcliff,  1990) is one of the most prominent approaches that mimics the association of past and present experiences in the brain. However, the performance of rehearsal-based approaches is poor under low buffer regimes, as it is commensurate with the buffer size(Bhat et al., 2022a). On the other hand, parameter isolation methods (Rusu et al., 2016)  present an extreme case of neurogenesis in which a new subnetwork is initialized for each task, thus greatly reducing task interference. Nevertheless, these approaches exhibit poor reusability of parameters and are not scalable due to the addition of a large number of parameters per task. Therefore, the right combination of the aforementioned mechanisms governed by GWT could unlock effective CL in DNNs while simultaneously encouraging reusability and mitigating catastrophic forgetting."><td>11</td><td>TASK-AWARE INFORMATION ROUTING FROM COMMON REPRESENTATION SPACE IN LIFELONG LEARNING</td><td>0.493</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Continual learning is a problem for artificial neural networks that their biological counterparts are adept at solving. Building on work using Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) to connect a core neural circuit with the powerful Transformer model, we create a modified Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) that is a strong continual learner. We find that every component of our MLP variant translated from biology is necessary for continual learning. Our solution is also free from any memory replay or task information, and introduces novel methods to train sparse networks that may be broadly applicable.Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 in the class incremental setting when memory replay is not allowed. Another variant of SDM, developed independently of our work, appears to be state-of-the-art for CIFAR-100, MNIST, and FashionMNIST, with our SDMLP as a close second(Shen et al., 2021).Excitingly, our continual learning success is &quot;organic&quot; in resulting from the underlying model architecture and does not require any task labels, task boundaries, or memory replay. Abstractly, SDM learns its subnetworks responsible for continual learning using two core model components. First, the Top-K activation function causes the k neurons most activated by an input to specialize towards this input, resulting in the formation of specialized subnetworks. Second, the L 2 normalization and absence of a bias term together constrain neurons to the data manifold, ensuring that all neurons democratically participate in learning. When these two components are combined, a new learning task only activates and trains a small subset of neurons, leaving the rest of the network intact to remember previous tasks without being overwritten As a roadmap of the paper, we first discuss related work (Section 2). We then provide a short introduction to SDM (Section 3), before translating it into our MLP (Section 4). Next we present our results, comparing the organic continual learning capabilities of our SDMLP against relevant benchmarks (Section 5). Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our work, sparse models more broadly, and how SDM relates MLPs to Transformer Attention (Section 6)."><td>12</td><td>SPARSE DISTRIBUTED MEMORY IS A CONTINUAL LEARNER</td><td>0.493</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="While recent continual learning methods largely alleviate the catastrophic problem on toy-sized datasets, some issues remain to be tackled to apply them to real-world problem domains. First, a continual learning model should effectively handle catastrophic forgetting and be efficient to train even with a large number of tasks. Secondly, it needs to tackle the problem of order-sensitivity, where the performance of the tasks largely varies based on the order of the task arrival sequence, as it may cause serious problems where fairness plays a critical role (e.g. medical diagnosis). To tackle these practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning method that is scalable as well as order-robust, which instead of learning a completely shared set of weights, represents the parameters for each task as a sum of task-shared and sparse task-adaptive parameters. With our Additive Parameter Decomposition (APD), the task-adaptive parameters for earlier tasks remain mostly unaffected, where we update them only to reflect the changes made to the task-shared parameters. This decomposition of parameters effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting and order-sensitivity, while being computation-and memory-efficient. Further, we can achieve even better scalability with APD using hierarchical knowledge consolidation, which clusters the task-adaptive parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters. We validate our network with APD, APD-Net, on multiple benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art continual learning methods, which it largely outperforms in accuracy, scalability, and order-robustness."><td>13</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 SCALABLE AND ORDER-ROBUST CONTINUAL LEARN- ING WITH ADDITIVE PARAMETER DECOMPOSITION</td><td>0.493</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Approaches to continual learning aim to successfully learn a set of related tasks that arrive in an online manner. Recently, several frameworks have been developed which enable deep learning to be deployed in this learning scenario. A key modelling decision is to what extent the architecture should be shared across tasks. On the one hand, separately modelling each task avoids catastrophic forgetting but it does not support transfer learning and leads to large models.On the other hand, rigidly specifying a shared component and a task-specific part enables task transfer and limits the model size, but it is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting and restricts the form of task-transfer that can occur.Ideally, the network should adaptively identify which parts of the network to share in a data driven way. Here we introduce such an approach called Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights (CLAW), which is based on probabilistic modelling and variational inference. Experiments show that CLAW achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks in terms of overall continual learning performance, as measured by classification accuracy, and in terms of addressing catastrophic forgetting."><td>14</td><td>Continual Learning with Adaptive Weights (CLAW)</td><td>0.494</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Continual (sequential) training and multitask (simultaneous) training are often attempting to solve the same overall objective: to find a solution that performs well on all considered tasks. The main difference is in the training regimes, where continual learning can only have access to one task at a time, which for neural networks typically leads to catastrophic forgetting. That is, the solution found for a subsequent task does not perform well on the previous ones anymore. However, the relationship between the different minima that the two training regimes arrive at is not well understood. What sets them apart? Is there a local structure that could explain the difference in performance achieved by the two different schemes? Motivated by recent work showing that different minima of the same task are typically connected by very simple curves of low error, we investigate whether multitask and continual solutions are similarly connected. We empirically find that indeed such connectivity can be reliably achieved and, more interestingly, it can be done by a linear path, conditioned on having the same initialization for both. We thoroughly analyze this observation and discuss its significance for the continual learning process. Furthermore, we exploit this finding to propose an effective algorithm that constrains the sequentially learned minima to behave as the multitask solution.

We find the bases of these subspaces by analyzing network representations (activations) after learning each task with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in a single shot manner and store them in the memory as Gradient Projection Memory (GPM).

Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks.

Observing that the trade-off between the quality and quantity of compressed data is highly nontrivial for the efficacy of memory replay, we propose a novel method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality for currently-arrived training samples. In this way, using a naive data compression algorithm with a properly selected quality can largely boost recent strong baselines by saving more compressed data in a limited storage space. We extensively validate this across several benchmarks of class-incremental learning and in a realistic scenario of object detection for autonomous driving. , et al.

To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task.

To achieve this we rely on a Gaussian process obtained by treating the weights of the last layer of a neural network as random and Gaussian distributed. Then, the training algorithm sequentially encounters tasks and constructs posterior beliefs over the task-specific functions by using inducing point sparse Gaussian process methods. At each step a new task is first learnt and then a summary is constructed consisting of (i) inducing inputs -a fixed-size subset of the task inputs selected such that it optimally represents the task -and (ii) a posterior distribution over the function values at these inputs.

Besides achieving state-ofthe-art performance on standard CL benchmarks, additional experiments on long task sequences reveal that task-conditioned hypernetworks display a very large capacity to retain previous memories. Notably, such long memory lifetimes are achieved in a compressive regime, when the number of trainable hypernetwork weights is comparable or smaller than target network size.

We find that when counting the model size into the total budget and comparing methods with aligned memory size, saving models do not consistently work, especially for the case with limited memory budgets.

We believe that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they measure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a task should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner in order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer should be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of representations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this notion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms on a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less forgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong correlation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new tasks.

Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to a different errorbased learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose ESMER which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsalbased system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We also propose Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data streams.

Our method, Memory-based Parameter Adaptation, stores examples in memory and then uses a context-based lookup to directly modify the weights of a neural network. Much higher learning rates can be used for this local adaptation, reneging the need for many iterations over similar data before good predictions can be made. As our method is memory-based, it alleviates several shortcomings of neural networks, such as catastrophic forgetting, fast, stable acquisition of new knowledge, learning with an imbalanced class labels, and fast learning during evaluation.

We draw inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems (CLS:McClelland et al., 1995;Leibo et al., 2015;Kumaran et al., 2016), where effective continual, life-long learning necessitates two complementary systems: one that allows for the gradual acquisition of structured knowledge, and another that allows rapid learning of the specifics of individual experiences. As such, MbPA consists of two components: a parametric component (a standard neural network) and a non-parametric component (a neural network augmented with a memory containing previous problem instances). The parametric component learns slowly but generalises well, whereas the non-parametric component rapidly adapts the weights of the parametric component. The non-parametric, instance-based adaptation of the weights is local, in the sense the modification is directly dictated by the inputs to the parametric component. The local adaptation is discarded after the model produces its output, avoiding long term consequences of strong local adaptation (such as overfitting), allowing the weights of the parametric model to learn slowly leading to strong performance and generalisation.The contributions of our work are: (i) proposing an architecture for enhancing powerful parametric models with a fast adaptation mechanism to efficiently cope with changes in the task at hand; (ii) establish connections between our method and attention mechanisms frequently used for querying memories; (iii) present a Bayesian interpretation of the method allowing a principled form of regularisation; (iv) evaluating the method on a range of different tasks: continual learning, incremental learning and data distribution shifts, obtaining promising results."><td>51</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018 MEMORY-BASED PARAMETER ADAPTATION</td><td>0.539</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Continual learning deals with training models on new tasks and datasets in an online fashion.

As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we propose a simple novel training paradigm, called Remembering for the Right Reasons (RRR), that additionally stores visual model explanations for each example in the buffer and ensures the model has &quot;the right reasons&quot; for its predictions by encouraging its explanations to remain consistent with those used to make decisions at training time. Without this constraint, there is a drift in explanations and increase in forgetting as conventional continual learning algorithms learn new tasks.

We adopt the recurrent neural network (RNN) widely used in NLP, but augment it with a directly parameterized memory bank, which is retrieved by an attention mechanism at each step of RNN transition. The memory bank provides a natural way of IDA: when adapting our model to a new domain, we progressively add new slots to the memory bank, which increases the number of parameters, and thus the model capacity. We learn the new memory slots and fine-tune existing parameters by back-propagation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than fine-tuning alone.

Typically, this is done by enlarging the model with new hidden states and a new predictor(Figure 1a). To avoid interfering with existing knowledge, the newly added hidden states are not fed back to the previously trained states. During training, all existing parameters are frozen, and only the newly added ones are trained. For inference, the new predictor is used for all domains, which is sometimes undesired as the new predictor is trained with only the last domain."><td>57</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 PROGRESSIVE MEMORY BANKS FOR INCREMENTAL DOMAIN ADAPTATION</td><td>0.547</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="A desirable dialog system should be able to continually learn new skills without forgetting old ones, and thereby adapt to new domains or tasks in its life cycle.

However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set problem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This will bring two big challenges to the existing temporal GNN methods: (i) How to dynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where new class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a sharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the embeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of these two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to different classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old classes when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs, called OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges. We assume the knowledge of a node can be disentangled into class-relevant and class-agnostic one, and thus explore a new message passing mechanism by extending the information bottleneck principle to only propagate class-agnostic knowledge between nodes of different classes, avoiding aggregating conflictive information. Moreover, we devise a strategy to select both important and diverse triad sub-graph structures for effective class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different domains demonstrate the superiority of our method, compared to the baselines."><td>75</td><td>TOWARDS OPEN TEMPORAL GRAPH NEURAL NET- WORKS</td><td>0.562</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge.

In this work, we focus on unsupervised continual learning (UCL), where we learn the feature representations on an unlabelled sequence of tasks and show that reliance on annotated data is not necessary for continual learning. We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-ofdistribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we find that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations.

However, when training artificial neural networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms. We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly allocate and recall 'artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark 'permuted MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark 'rotated MNIST' demonstrates how similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble."><td>77</td><td>ARTIFICIAL NEURONAL ENSEMBLES WITH LEARNED CONTEXT DEPENDENT GATING</td><td>0.563</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We introduce Progressive Prompts -a simple and efficient approach for continual learning in language models.

These limitations call for an intent detection system that could continually recognize new intents with very few labeled examples. In this work, we study the Continual Few-shot Intent Detection (CFID) problem and construct a benchmark consisting of nine tasks with multiple domains and imbalanced classes.

To date, research into compositional learning has largely proceeded separately from work on lifelong or continual learning. We integrate these two lines of work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of compositional structures that can be used for solving a stream of related tasks. Our framework separates the learning process into two broad stages: learning how to best combine existing components in order to assimilate a novel problem, and learning how to adapt the set of existing components to accommodate the new problem.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear under what conditions the trained model's performance improves or deteriorates. To deepen our understanding of sequential training, this study provides a theoretical analysis of generalization performance in a solvable case of continual learning. We consider neural networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that continually learn target functions from task to task, and investigate the generalization by using an established statistical mechanical analysis of kernel ridge-less regression. We first show characteristic transitions from positive to negative transfer. More similar targets above a specific critical value can achieve positive knowledge transfer for the subsequent task while catastrophic forgetting occurs even with very similar targets. Next, we investigate a variant of continual learning which supposes the same target function in multiple tasks. Even for the same target, the trained model shows some transfer and forgetting depending on the sample size of each task. We can guarantee that the generalization error monotonically decreases from task to task for equal sample sizes while unbalanced sample sizes deteriorate the generalization. We respectively refer to these improvement and deterioration as self-knowledge transfer and forgetting, and empirically confirm them in realistic training of deep neural networks as well."><td>81</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022 LEARNING CURVES FOR CONTINUAL LEARNING IN NEURAL NETWORKS: SELF-KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND FORGETTING</td><td>0.568</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="A core aspect of human intelligence is the ability to learn new tasks quickly and switch between them flexibly.

We formulate such challenging scenarios as incremental event detection, which requires a model to learn new classes incrementally without performance degradation on previous classes. However, existing incremental learning methods cannot handle semantic ambiguity and training data imbalance problems between old and new classes in the task of incremental event detection. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Consolidation Network (KCN) to address the above issues.

First, the target task is predefined and static; a system merely needs to learn to solve it exclusively. Second, the supervision of a task mainly comes from a set of labeled examples. A question arises: how to build a system that can keep learning new tasks from their instructions?This work defines a new learning paradigm ConTinTin (Continual Learning from Task Instructions), in which a system should learn a sequence of new tasks one by one, each task is explained by a piece of textual instruction. The system is required to (i) generate the expected outputs of a new task by learning from its instruction, (ii) transfer the knowledge acquired from upstream tasks to help solve downstream tasks (i.e., forward-transfer), and (iii) retain or even improve the performance on earlier tasks after learning new tasks (i.e., backward-transfer). This new problem is studied on a stream of more than 60 tasks, each equipped with an instruction. Technically, our method InstructionSpeak contains two strategies that make full use of task instructions to improve forward-transfer and backward-transfer: one is to learn from negative outputs, the other is to re-visit instructions of previous tasks.
