We perform a simple extractive step before generating a summary, which is then used to condition the transformer language model on relevant information before being tasked with generating a summary. We also show that this approach produces more abstractive summaries compared to prior work that employs a copy mechanism while still achieving higher ROUGE scores. We provide extensive comparisons with strong baseline methods, prior state of the art work as well as multiple variants of our approach including those using only transformers, only extractive techniques and combinations of the two. We examine these models using four different summarization tasks and datasets: arXiv papers, PubMed papers, the Newsroom and BigPatent datasets. We find that transformer based methods produce summaries with fewer n-gram copies, leading to n-gram copying statistics that are more similar to human generated abstracts. We include a human evaluation, finding that transformers are ranked highly for coherence and fluency, but purely extractive methods score higher for informativeness and relevance. We hope that these architectures and experiments may serve as strong points of comparison for future work. 1AbstractWe demonstrate that Transformer language models are extremely promising at summarizing long texts, and provide a new approach to deep summarization that can be used to generate more &quot;abstractive&quot; summaries.

Despite promising recent results, we find evidence that reference-free evaluation metrics of summarization and dialog generation may be relying on spurious correlations with measures such as word overlap, perplexity, and length. We further observe that for text summarization, these metrics have high error rates when ranking current state-ofthe-art abstractive summarization systems.

To alleviate this issue, recent work has proposed evaluation metrics which rely on question answering models to assess whether a summary contains all the relevant information in its source document. Though promising, the proposed approaches have so far failed to correlate better than ROUGE with human judgments.In this paper, we extend previous approaches and propose a unified framework, named QuestEval.In contrast to established metrics such as ROUGE or BERTScore, QuestEval does not require any groundtruth reference. Nonetheless, QuestEval substantially improves the correlation with human judgments over four evaluation dimensions (consistency, coherence, fluency, and relevance), as shown in the extensive experiments we report."><td>3</td><td>QuestEval: Summarization Asks for Fact-based Evaluation</td><td>0.453</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="ROUGE is widely used to automatically evaluate summarization systems. However, ROUGE measures semantic overlap between a system summary and a human reference on word-string level, much at odds with the contemporary treatment of semantic meaning. Here we present a suite of experiments on using distributed representations for evaluating summarizers, both in reference-based and in reference-free setting. Our experimental results show that the max value over each dimension of the summary ELMo word embeddings is a good representation that results in high correlation with human ratings. Averaging the cosine similarity of all encoders we tested yields high correlation with manual scores in reference-free setting. The distributed representations outperform ROUGE in recent corpora for abstractive news summarization but are less good on older test data and systems."><td>4</td><td>The Feasibility of Embedding Based Automatic Evaluation for Single Document Summarization</td><td>0.456</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present BLANC, a new approach to the automatic estimation of document summary quality.

We present evidence that BLANC scores have as good correlation with human evaluations as do the ROUGE family of summary quality measurements.

Previous approaches, such as ROUGE, mainly consider the informativeness of the assessed summary and require human-generated references for each test summary. In this work, we propose to evaluate the summary qualities without reference summaries by unsupervised contrastive learning. Specifically, we design a new metric which covers both linguistic qualities and semantic informativeness based on BERT. To learn the metric, for each summary, we construct different types of negative samples with respect to different aspects of the summary qualities, and train our model with a ranking loss. Experiments on Newsroom and CNN/Daily Mail demonstrate that our new evaluation method outperforms other metrics even without reference summaries. Furthermore, we show that our method is general and transferable across datasets."><td>6</td><td>Unsupervised Reference-Free Summary Quality Evaluation via Contrastive Learning</td><td>0.458</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Automatic summarization generates concise summaries that contain key ideas of source documents. As the most mainstream datasets for the news sub-domain, CNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum have been widely used for performance benchmarking. However, the reference summaries of those datasets turn out to be noisy, mainly in terms of factual hallucination and information redundancy. To address this challenge, we first annotate new expertwriting Element-aware test sets following the &quot;Lasswell Communication Model&quot; proposed by Lasswell (1948), allowing reference summaries to focus on more fine-grained news elements objectively and comprehensively. Utilizing the new test sets, we observe the surprising zero-shot summary ability of LLMs, which addresses the issue of the inconsistent results between human preference and automatic evaluation metrics of LLMs' zero-shot summaries in prior work. Further, we propose a Summary Chain-of-Thought (SumCoT) technique to elicit LLMs to generate summaries step by step, which helps them integrate more finegrained details of source documents into the final summaries that correlate with the human writing mindset. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuned PLMs and zero-shot LLMs by +4.33/+4.77 in ROUGE-L on the two datasets, respectively.

However, in this work, we demonstrate that these reference-free metrics are inherently biased and limited in their ability to evaluate generated text, and we argue that they should not be used to measure progress on tasks like machine translation or summarization. We show how reference-free metrics are equivalent to using one generation model to evaluate another, which has several limitations: (1) the metrics can be optimized at test time to find the approximate best-possible output, (2) they are inherently biased toward models which are more similar to their own, and (3) they can be biased against higher-quality outputs, including those written by humans. Therefore, we recommend that reference-free metrics should be used as diagnostic tools for analyzing and understanding model behavior instead of measures of how well models perform a task, in which the goal is to achieve as high of a score as possible. 1 1), pages 314-319, Florence, Italy.

Primarily, we find that 1) under similar settings, extractive summarizers are in general better than their abstractive counterparts thanks to strength in faithfulness and factual-consistency; 2) milestone techniques such as copy, coverage and hybrid extractive/abstractive methods do bring specific improvements but also demonstrate limitations; 3) pre-training techniques, and in particular sequence-to-sequence pre-training, are highly effective for improving text summarization, with BART giving the best results. * Equal contribution. † Corresponding author. 1 MQM is a framework for declaring and describing human writing quality which stipulates a hierarchical listing of error types restricted to human writing and translation."><td>11</td><td>What Have We Achieved on Text Summarization?</td><td>0.474</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We study correlation of rankings of text summarization systems using evaluation methods with and without human models.

However, human evaluation is very difficult to reproduce and its quality is notoriously unstable, hindering fair comparisons among different natural language processing (NLP) models and algorithms. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen tasks when only the task instructions are provided. In this paper, we explore if such an ability of the LLMs can be used as an alternative to human evaluation. We present the LLMs with the exact same instructions, samples to be evaluated, and questions used to conduct human evaluation, and then ask the LLMs to generate responses to those questions; we dub this LLM evaluation. We use human evaluation and LLM evaluation to evaluate the texts in two NLP tasks: openended story generation and adversarial attacks. We show that the result of LLM evaluation is consistent with the results obtained by expert human evaluation: the texts rated higher by human experts are also rated higher by the LLMs. We also find that the results of LLM evaluation are stable over different formatting of the task instructions and the sampling algorithm used to generate the answer. We are the first to show the potential of using LLMs to assess the quality of texts and discuss the limitations and ethical considerations of LLM evaluation. , et al. 2020.

In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans.

We thus explore and propose alternative evaluation measures: the reported humanevaluation analysis shows that the proposed metrics, based on Question Answering, favorably compares to ROUGE -with the additional property of not requiring reference summaries. Training a RL-based model on these metrics leads to improvements (both in terms of human or automated metrics) over current approaches that use ROUGE as a reward."><td>17</td><td>Answers Unite!

However, source code with missing, incorrect, or outdated summaries is a common occurrence in production code. Automatic source code summarisation seeks to solve these issues by generating up-to-date summaries of source code methods. Recent work in automatically generating source code summaries uses neural networks for generating summaries; commonly Sequence-to-Sequence or Transformer models, pretrained on methodsummary pairs. The most common method of evaluating the quality of these summaries is comparing the machine-generated summaries against human-written summaries. Summaries can be evaluated using n-gram-based translation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, or ROUGE-L. However, these metrics alone can be unreliable and new Natural Language Generation metrics based on large pretrained language models provide an alternative. In this paper, we propose a method of improving the evaluation of a model by improving the preprocessing of the data used to train it, as well as proposing evaluating the model with a metric based off a language model, pretrained on a Natural Language (English) alongside traditional metrics. Our evaluation suggests our model has been improved by cleaning and preprocessing the data used in model training. The addition of a pretrained language model metric alongside traditional metrics shows that both produce results which can be used to evaluate neural source code summarisation."><td>18</td><td>Improved Evaluation of Automatic Source Code Summarisation</td><td>0.488</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of abstractive text summarization with focused contributions in relevant model architectures, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Despite notable research advances, previous works have identified certain limitations concerning the quality of datasets and the effectiveness of evaluation techniques for generated summaries. In this context, we examine these limitations further with the help of three quality measures, namely, Information Coverage, Entity Hallucination, and Summarization Complexity. As a part of this work, we investigate two widely used datasets (XSUM and CNN-DM) and three existing models (BART, PEGA-SUS, and BRIO) and report our findings. Some key insights are: 1) Cumulative ROUGE score is an inappropriate evaluation measure since few high-scoring samples dominate the overall performance, 2) Existing summarization models have limited capability for information coverage and hallucinate to generate factual information, and 3) Compared to the modelgenerated summaries, the reference summaries have lowest information coverage and highest entity hallucinations reiterating the need of new and better reference summaries."><td>19</td><td>Hiding in Plain Sight: Insights into Abstractive Text Summarization</td><td>0.489</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain question answering (QA). Unfortunately, lexical matching fails completely when a plausible candidate answer does not appear in the list of gold answers, which is increasingly the case as we shift from extractive to generative models. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical matching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making matching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-OPEN, a popular benchmark. Our assessments reveal that while the true performance of all models is significantly underestimated, the performance of the InstructGPT (zero-shot) LLM increases by nearly +60%, making it on par with existing top models, and the InstructGPT (few-shot) model actually achieves a new state-of-the-art on NQ-OPEN. We also find that more than 50% of lexical matching failures are attributed to semantically equivalent answers. We further demonstrate that regex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still suffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human evaluation."><td>20</td><td>Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models</td><td>0.491</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Task-agnostic pretraining objectives like masked language models or corrupted span prediction are applicable to a wide range of NLP downstream tasks(Raffel et al., 2019), but are outperformed by task-specific pretraining objectives like predicting extracted gap sentences on summarization .

Towards this goal, recent works have begun to train language models on narrative datasets which require extracting the most critical information by integrating across long contexts. However, it is still an open question whether these models are learning a deeper understanding of the text, or if the models are simply learning a heuristic to complete the task. This work investigates this further by turning to the one language processing system that truly understands complex language: the human brain. We show that training language models for deeper narrative understanding results in richer representations that have improved alignment to human brain activity. We further find that the improvements in brain alignment are larger for character names than for other discourse features, which indicates that these models are learning important narrative elements. Taken together, these results suggest that this type of training can indeed lead to deeper language understanding. These findings have consequences both for cognitive neuroscience by revealing some of the significant factors behind brain-NLP alignment, and for NLP by highlighting that understanding of long-range context can be improved beyond language modeling.We specifically investigate 4 pretrained language models (i.e., &quot;base models&quot;) and 4 corresponding models obtained by training the base models on the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2021)  to improve the base language model's narrative understanding (i.e., &quot;booksum models&quot;). The Book-Sum dataset was selected because it is a summarization dataset that requires understanding complex interactions across long narratives. The 4 models were selected because their architectures were designed to integrate information across long contexts. We evaluate the alignment of the base and booksum models with fMRI recordings of 8 participants reading a chapter of a popular book wordby-word, made publicly available by Wehbe et al. (2014a). This dataset was chosen because it is one of the largest datasets of participants processing a narrative story (5176 words which corresponds to approximately 1300 samples of fMRI recordings per participant).Our main contributions are as follows:1. In Section 4, we show that training language models for deeper narrative understanding improves alignment to human brain activity. Also, when increasing the number of words fed to the models, up to 500 words, brain alignment increases. Lastly, for each model, we identify the layers where these improvements in brain alignment occur. 2. In Section 5, we show that improved brain alignment in Section 4 is not due to improved language modeling (LM) ability, a possible confounding factor. By disentangling LM ability's contribution to brain alignment, we present evidence that BookSum-trained models develop deeper language understanding. 3. In Section 6, we present a simple interpretability approach to study what brain-relevant information is gained by language models after training for deeper language understanding. Our results reveal that these models are learning richer representations across all tested discourse features (Characters, Emotions, Motions). Furthermore, they learn more about Characters than Emotions and Motions. This indicates that discourse features are a promising dimension to study brain alignment and deep language understanding.Combined, our contributions from Sections 4, 5, and 6 present evidence that models trained to summarize narratives indeed develop deeper language understanding. The first reason is that improved alignment to human brains' deep understanding of characters, emotions and motions suggests the model has developed richer representations of these entities and concepts. Second, we focus on brain regions suggested by previous research to underlie language comprehension in humans. Hence, improved brain alignment is not spuriously related to non-language brain activities. Third, we show that brain alignment improves only when we provide longer input contexts (20 to 1000 words) to the LMs, which may be important for deep contextual understanding."><td>27</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS TO SUMMARIZE NARRATIVES IMPROVES BRAIN ALIGNMENT</td><td>0.499</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We present REFEREE, a novel framework for sentence summarization that can be trained reference-free (i.e., requiring no gold summaries for supervision), while allowing direct control for compression ratio.

In this paper, we study a challenging low-resource setting of summarizing long legal briefs with an average source document length of 4268 words and only 120 available (document, summary) pairs. To account for data scarcity, we used a modern pretrained abstractive summarizer BART (Lewis et al., 2020), which only achieves 17.9 ROUGE-L as it struggles with long documents. We thus attempt to compress these long documents by identifying salient sentences in the source which best ground the summary, using a novel algorithm based on GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) language model perplexity scores, that operates within the low resource regime. On feeding the compressed documents to BART, we observe a 6.0 ROUGE-L improvement. Our method also beats several competitive salience detection baselines.

We compared both transformer and long short-term memory LMs to find that, contrary to humans, implicit causality only influences LM behavior for reference, not syntax, despite model representations that encode the necessary discourse information.
