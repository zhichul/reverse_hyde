We take a close look into this problem, aiming to answer two questions: (1) Do PLMs learn to become calibrated in the training process? (2) How effective are existing calibration methods? For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs' confidence in wrong predictions.

However, fine-tuned models still suffer from overconfident predictions, especially in out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we tackle the problem of calibrating finetuned language models. We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models. Among these methods, our proposed method that encourages the fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language modeling objective achieves competitive accuracy and the lowest expected calibration error compared to several strong baselines under both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on three downstream NLU tasks. * Corresponding authors."><td>3</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 PRESERVING PRE-TRAINED FEATURES HELPS CALIBRATE FINE-TUNED LANGUAGE MODELS</td><td>0.420</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Pre-trained Transformers are now ubiquitous in natural language processing, but despite their high end-task performance, little is known empirically about whether they are calibrated. Specifically, do these models' posterior probabilities provide an accurate empirical measure of how likely the model is to be correct on a given example? We focus on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)  and RoBERTa  (Liu et al., 2019)  in this work, and analyze their calibration across three tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning. For each task, we consider in-domain as well as challenging outof-domain settings, where models face more examples they should be uncertain about. We show that: (1) when used out-of-the-box, pretrained models are calibrated in-domain, and compared to baselines, their calibration error out-of-domain can be as much as 3.5× lower;(2) temperature scaling is effective at further reducing calibration error in-domain, and using label smoothing to deliberately increase empirical uncertainty helps calibrate posteriors out-of-domain. 1"><td>4</td><td>Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers</td><td>0.424</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="We investigate model calibration in the setting of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer with largescale pre-trained language models. The level of model calibration is an important metric for evaluating the trustworthiness of predictive models. There exists an essential need for model calibration when natural language models are deployed in critical tasks. We study different post-training calibration methods in structured and unstructured prediction tasks. We find that models trained with data from the source language become less calibrated when applied to the target language and that calibration errors increase with intrinsic task difficulty and relative sparsity of training data. Moreover, we observe a potential connection between the level of calibration error and an earlier proposed measure of the distance from English to other languages. Finally, our comparison demonstrates that among other methods Temperature Scaling (TS) generalizes well to distant languages, but TS fails to calibrate more complex confidence estimation in structured predictions compared to more expressive alternatives like Gaussian Process Calibration."><td>5</td><td>Calibrating Zero-shot Cross-lingual (Un-)structured Predictions</td><td>0.431</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In-context learning of GPT-like models has been recognized as fragile across different hand-crafted templates, and demonstration permutations. In this work, we propose prototypical calibration to adaptively learn a more robust decision boundary for zero-and few-shot classification, instead of greedy decoding. Concretely, our method first adopts Gaussian mixture distribution to estimate the prototypical clusters for all categories. Then we assign each cluster to the corresponding label by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem. Given an example, its prediction is calibrated by the likelihood of prototypical clusters. Experimental results show that prototypical calibration yields a substantial improvement on a diverse set of tasks. Extensive analysis across different scales also indicates that our method calibrates the decision boundary as expected, greatly improving the robustness of GPT to templates, permutations, and class imbalance."><td>6</td><td>Prototypical Calibration for Few-shot Learning of Language Models</td><td>0.439</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Question answering models can use rich knowledge sources -up to one hundred retrieved passages and parametric knowledge in the large-scale language model (LM). Prior work assumes information in such knowledge sources is consistent with each other, paying little attention to how models blend information stored in their LM parameters with that from retrieved evidence documents. In this paper, we simulate knowledge conflicts (i.e., where parametric knowledge suggests one answer and different passages suggest different answers) and examine model behaviors. We find retrieval performance heavily impacts which sources models rely on, and current models mostly rely on non-parametric knowledge in their best-performing settings. We discover a troubling trend that contradictions among knowledge sources affect model confidence only marginally. To address this issue, we present a new calibration study, where models are discouraged from presenting any single answer when presented with multiple conflicting answer candidates in retrieved evidences."><td>7</td><td>Rich Knowledge Sources Bring Complex Knowledge Conflicts: Recalibrating Models to Reflect Conflicting Evidence</td><td>0.448</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In typical machine learning systems, an estimate of the probability of the prediction is used to assess the system's confidence in the prediction. This confidence measure is usually uncalibrated; i.e. the system's confidence in the prediction does not match the true probability of the predicted output. In this paper, we present an investigation into calibrating open setting machine reading systems such as open-domain question answering and claim verification systems. We show that calibrating such complex systems which contain a discrete retrieval and deep reading components is challenging and current calibration techniques fail to scale to these settings. We propose simple extensions to existing calibration approaches that allow us to adapt these callibrators to these settings. Our experimental results reveal that the joint callibration of the retriever and the reader outperforms the reader calibrator by a significant margin. We also show that the callibrator can be useful for selective prediction, e.g., when question answering systems are posed with unanswerable or out-ofthe-training distribution questions."><td>8</td><td>Calibration of Machine Reading Systems at Scale</td><td>0.448</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="While pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become a de-facto standard promoting the accuracy of text classification tasks, recent studies(Kong et al., 2020;Dan and Roth, 2021)find that PLMs often predict over-confidently. Although various calibration methods have been proposed, such as ensemble learning and data augmentation, most of the methods have been verified in computer vision benchmarks rather than in PLM-based text classification tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study on confidence calibration for PLMs, addressing three categories, including confidence penalty losses, data augmentations, and ensemble methods. We find that the ensemble model overfitted to the training set shows sub-par calibration performance and also observe that PLMs trained with confidence penalty loss have a trade-off between calibration and accuracy. Building on these observations, we propose the Calibrated PLM (CALL), a combination of calibration techniques. The CALL complements the drawbacks that may occur when utilizing a calibration method individually and boosts both classification and calibration accuracy. Design choices in CALL's training procedures are extensively studied, and we provide a detailed analysis of how calibration techniques affect the calibration performance of PLMs."><td>9</td><td>Bag of Tricks for In-Distribution Calibration of Pretrained Transformers</td><td>0.451</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="According to the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP), ranking documents in decreasing order of their probability of relevance leads to an optimal document ranking for ad-hoc retrieval. The PRP holds when two conditions are met:[C1] the models are well calibrated, and, [C2] the probabilities of relevance are reported with certainty. We know however that deep neural networks (DNNs) are often not well calibrated and have several sources of uncertainty, and thus [C1] and [C2] might not be satisfied by neural rankers. Given the success of neural Learning to Rank (L2R) approaches-and here, especially BERT-based approaches-we first analyze under which circumstances deterministic neural rankers are calibrated for conversational search problems. Then, motivated by our findings we use two techniques to model the uncertainty of neural rankers leading to the proposed stochastic rankers, which output a predictive distribution of relevance as opposed to point estimates. Our experimental results on the ad-hoc retrieval task of conversation response ranking 1 reveal that (i) BERTbased rankers are not robustly calibrated and that stochastic BERT-based rankers yield better calibration; and (ii) uncertainty estimation is beneficial for both risk-aware neural ranking, i.e. taking into account the uncertainty when ranking documents, and for predicting unanswerable conversational contexts."><td>10</td><td>On the Calibration and Uncertainty of Neural Learning to Rank Models for Conversational Search</td><td>0.452</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Knowledge graph embedding research has overlooked the problem of probability calibration. We show popular embedding models are indeed uncalibrated. That means probability estimates associated to predicted triples are unreliable. We present a novel method to calibrate a model when ground truth negatives are not available, which is the usual case in knowledge graphs. We propose to use Platt scaling and isotonic regression alongside our method. Experiments on three datasets with ground truth negatives show our contribution leads to well calibrated models when compared to the gold standard of using negatives. We get significantly better results than the uncalibrated models from all calibration methods. We show isotonic regression offers the best the performance overall, not without trade-offs. We also show that calibrated models reach state-of-the-art accuracy without the need to define relation-specific decision thresholds.INTRODUCTIONKnowledge graph embedding models are neural architectures that learn vector representations (i.e. embeddings) of nodes and edges of a knowledge graph. Such knowledge graph embeddings have applications in knowledge graph completion, knowledge discovery, entity resolution, and link-based clustering, just to cite a few(Nickel et al., 2016a).Despite burgeoning research, the problem of calibrating such models has been overlooked, and existing knowledge graph embedding models do not offer any guarantee on the probability estimates they assign to predicted facts. Probability calibration is important whenever you need the predictions to make probabilistic sense, i.e., if the model predicts a fact is true with 80% confidence, it should to be correct 80% of the times. Prior art suggests to use a sigmoid layer to turn logits returned by models into probabilities (Nickel et al., 2016a) (also called the expit transform), but we show that this provides poor calibration.Figure 1shows reliability diagrams for off-the-shelf TransE and ComplEx. The identity function represents perfect calibration. Both models are miscalibrated: all TransE combinations inFigure 1aunder-forecast the probabilities (i.e. probabilities are too small), whereas ComplEx under-forecasts or over-forecasts according to which loss is used(Figure1b).Calibration is crucial in high-stakes scenarios such as drug-target discovery from biological networks, where end-users need trustworthy and interpretable decisions. Moreover, since probabilities are not calibrated, when classifying triples (i.e. facts) as true or false, users must define relationspecific thresholds, which can be awkward for graphs with a great number of relation types.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to focus on calibration for knowledge embeddings. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we use Platt Scaling and isotonic regression to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models on datasets that include ground truth negatives. One peculiar feature of knowledge graphs is that they usually rely on the open world assumption (facts not present are not necessarily false, they are simply unknown). This makes calibration troublesome because of the lack of ground truth negatives. For this reason, our second and main contribution is a calibration heuristics that combines Platt-scaling or isotonic regression with synthetically generated negatives.Experimental results show that we obtain better-calibrated models and that it is possible to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models even when ground truth negatives are not present.

Knowledge of a teacher is considered a subject that holds interclass relations which send a meaningful supervision to a student; hence, much effort has been put to find such knowledge to be distilled. In this paper, we explore a question that has been given little attention: &quot;when to distill such knowledge.&quot; The question is answered in our work with the concept of model calibration; we view a teacher model not only as a source of knowledge but also as a gauge to detect miscalibration of a student. This simple and yet novel view leads to a hard gate knowledge distillation scheme that switches between learning from a teacher model and training data. We verify the gating mechanism in the context of natural language generation at both the token-level and the sentence-level. Empirical comparisons with strong baselines show that hard gate knowledge distillation not only improves model generalization, but also significantly lowers model calibration error."><td>12</td><td>Hard Gate Knowledge Distillation - Leverage Calibration for a Robust and Reliable Language Model</td><td>0.474</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Many models in natural language processing define probabilistic distributions over linguistic structures. We argue that (1) the quality of a model's posterior distribution can and should be directly evaluated, as to whether probabilities correspond to empirical frequencies; and (2) NLP uncertainty can be projected not only to pipeline components, but also to exploratory data analysis, telling a user when to trust and not trust the NLP analysis. We present a method to analyze calibration, and apply it to compare the miscalibration of several commonly used models. We also contribute a coreference sampling algorithm that can create confidence intervals for a political event extraction task. 1"><td>13</td><td>Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models</td><td>0.479</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Large language models have achieved impressive few-shot performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, in many settings, users require confidence estimates for model predictions. While traditional classifiers produce scores for each label, language models instead produce scores for the generation which may not be well calibrated. We compare generations across diverse prompts and show that these can be used to create confidence scores. By utilizing more prompts we can get more precise confidence estimates and use response diversity as a proxy for confidence. We evaluate this approach across ten multiple-choice questionanswering datasets using three models: T0, FLAN-T5, and GPT-3. In addition to analyzing multiple human written prompts, we automatically generate more prompts using a language model in order to produce finer-grained confidence estimates. Our method produces more calibrated confidence estimates compared to the log probability of the answer to a single prompt. These improvements could benefit users who rely on prediction confidence for integration into a larger system or in decisionmaking processes."><td>14</td><td>Strength in Numbers: Estimating Confidence of Large Language Models by Prompt Agreement</td><td>0.479</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Certainty calibration is an important goal on the path to interpretability and trustworthy AI. Particularly in the context of human-in-theloop systems, high-quality low to mid-range certainty estimates are essential. In the presence of a dominant high-certainty class, for instance the non-entity class in NER problems, existing calibration error measures are completely insensitive to potentially large errors in this certainty region of interest. We introduce a region-balanced calibration error metric that weights all certainty regions equally. When low and mid certainty estimates are taken into account, calibration error is typically larger than previously reported. We introduce a simple extension of temperature scaling, requiring no additional computation, that can reduce both traditional and region-balanced notions of calibration error over existing baselines."><td>15</td><td>Region-dependent temperature scaling for certainty calibration and application to class-imbalanced token classification</td><td>0.480</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="NLP practitioners often want to take existing trained models and apply them to data from new domains. While fine-tuning or few-shot learning can be used to adapt a base model, there is no single recipe for making these techniques work; moreover, one may not have access to the original model weights if it is deployed as a black box. We study how to improve a black box model's performance on a new domain by leveraging explanations of the model's behavior. Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about the task with model attributions generated by black box interpretation techniques, then uses a simple calibrator, in the form of a classifier, to predict whether the base model was correct or not. We experiment with our method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language inference, covering adaptation from several pairs of domains with limited target-domain data. The experimental results across all the domain pairs show that explanations are useful for calibrating these models, boosting accuracy when predictions do not have to be returned on every example. We further show that the calibration model transfers to some extent between tasks. 1"><td>16</td><td>Can Explanations Be Useful for Calibrating Black Box Models?</td><td>0.481</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Most classification models work by first predicting a posterior probability distribution over all classes and then selecting that class with the largest estimated probability. In many settings however, the quality of posterior probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and empirical posterior probabilities. We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al.,  2018)  compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization term. Also, PosCal has the advantage that it incrementally tracks needed statistics for the calibration objective during the training process, making efficient use of large training sets 1 ."><td>17</td><td>Posterior Calibrated Training on Sentence Classification Tasks</td><td>0.483</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="In this work, we explore joint energy-based model (EBM) training during the finetuning of pretrained text encoders (e.g., Roberta) for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks.

We discuss three variants of energy functions (namely scalar, hidden, and sharp-hidden) that can be defined on top of a text encoder, and compare them in experiments. Due to the discreteness of text data, we adopt noise contrastive estimation (NCE) to train the energy-based model.

This selective prediction ability is crucial for NLP systems to be reliably deployed in real-world applications. Prior work has shown that existing selective prediction techniques fail to perform well, especially in the out-of-domain setting. In this work, we propose a method that improves probability estimates of models by calibrating them using prediction confidence and difficulty score of instances. Using these two signals, we first annotate held-out instances and then train a calibrator to predict the likelihood of correctness of the model's prediction. We instantiate our method with Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Duplicate Detection (DD) tasks and evaluate it in both In-Domain (IID) and Outof-Domain (OOD) settings. In (IID, OOD) settings, we show that the representations learned by our calibrator result in an improvement of (15.81%, 5.64%) and (6.19%, 13.9%) over MaxProb -a selective prediction baseline-on NLI and DD tasks respectively."><td>19</td><td>Towards Improving Selective Prediction Ability of NLP Systems</td><td>0.490</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Conditional language models are predominantly trained with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), giving probability mass to sparsely observed target sequences. While MLE trained models assign high probability to plausible sequences given the context, the model probabilities often do not accurately rank-order generated sequences by quality. This has been empirically observed in beam search decoding as output quality degrading with large beam sizes, and decoding strategies benefiting from heuristics such as length normalization and repetition-blocking. In this work, we introduce sequence likelihood calibration (SLiC) where the likelihood of model generated sequences are calibrated to better align with reference sequences in the model's latent space. With SLiC, decoding heuristics become unnecessary and decoding candidates' quality significantly improves regardless of the decoding method. Furthermore, SLiC shows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative ways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets. With SLiC, we exceed or match SOTA results on a wide range of generation tasks spanning abstractive summarization, question generation, abstractive question answering and data-to-text generation, even with modest-sized models."><td>20</td><td>CALIBRATING SEQUENCE LIKELIHOOD IMPROVES CONDITIONAL LANGUAGE GENERATION</td><td>0.492</td></tr></tbody></table>

We take a close look into this problem, aiming to answer two questions: (1) Do PLMs learn to become calibrated in the training process? (2) How effective are existing calibration methods? For the first question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples, training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining. We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors. We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable methods significantly reduce PLMs' confidence in wrong predictions.

We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models. Among these methods, our proposed method that encourages the fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language modeling objective achieves competitive accuracy and the lowest expected calibration error compared to several strong baselines under both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on three downstream NLU tasks. * Corresponding authors."><td>3</td><td>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 PRESERVING PRE-TRAINED FEATURES HELPS CALIBRATE FINE-TUNED LANGUAGE MODELS</td><td>0.420</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="Pre-trained Transformers are now ubiquitous in natural language processing, but despite their high end-task performance, little is known empirically about whether they are calibrated.

Then we assign each cluster to the corresponding label by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem. Given an example, its prediction is calibrated by the likelihood of prototypical clusters. Experimental results show that prototypical calibration yields a substantial improvement on a diverse set of tasks.

In this paper, we simulate knowledge conflicts (i.e., where parametric knowledge suggests one answer and different passages suggest different answers) and examine model behaviors. We find retrieval performance heavily impacts which sources models rely on, and current models mostly rely on non-parametric knowledge in their best-performing settings. We discover a troubling trend that contradictions among knowledge sources affect model confidence only marginally.

We show that calibrating such complex systems which contain a discrete retrieval and deep reading components is challenging and current calibration techniques fail to scale to these settings. We propose simple extensions to existing calibration approaches that allow us to adapt these callibrators to these settings.

Although various calibration methods have been proposed, such as ensemble learning and data augmentation, most of the methods have been verified in computer vision benchmarks rather than in PLM-based text classification tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study on confidence calibration for PLMs, addressing three categories, including confidence penalty losses, data augmentations, and ensemble methods. We find that the ensemble model overfitted to the training set shows sub-par calibration performance and also observe that PLMs trained with confidence penalty loss have a trade-off between calibration and accuracy. Building on these observations, we propose the Calibrated PLM (CALL), a combination of calibration techniques. The CALL complements the drawbacks that may occur when utilizing a calibration method individually and boosts both classification and calibration accuracy.

We show popular embedding models are indeed uncalibrated. That means probability estimates associated to predicted triples are unreliable. We present a novel method to calibrate a model when ground truth negatives are not available, which is the usual case in knowledge graphs. We propose to use Platt scaling and isotonic regression alongside our method. Experiments on three datasets with ground truth negatives show our contribution leads to well calibrated models when compared to the gold standard of using negatives. We get significantly better results than the uncalibrated models from all calibration methods. We show isotonic regression offers the best the performance overall, not without trade-offs. We also show that calibrated models reach state-of-the-art accuracy without the need to define relation-specific decision thresholds.INTRODUCTIONKnowledge graph embedding models are neural architectures that learn vector representations (i.e. embeddings) of nodes and edges of a knowledge graph. Such knowledge graph embeddings have applications in knowledge graph completion, knowledge discovery, entity resolution, and link-based clustering, just to cite a few(Nickel et al., 2016a).Despite burgeoning research, the problem of calibrating such models has been overlooked, and existing knowledge graph embedding models do not offer any guarantee on the probability estimates they assign to predicted facts. Probability calibration is important whenever you need the predictions to make probabilistic sense, i.e., if the model predicts a fact is true with 80% confidence, it should to be correct 80% of the times. Prior art suggests to use a sigmoid layer to turn logits returned by models into probabilities (Nickel et al., 2016a) (also called the expit transform), but we show that this provides poor calibration.Figure 1shows reliability diagrams for off-the-shelf TransE and ComplEx. The identity function represents perfect calibration. Both models are miscalibrated: all TransE combinations inFigure 1aunder-forecast the probabilities (i.e. probabilities are too small), whereas ComplEx under-forecasts or over-forecasts according to which loss is used(Figure1b).Calibration is crucial in high-stakes scenarios such as drug-target discovery from biological networks, where end-users need trustworthy and interpretable decisions. Moreover, since probabilities are not calibrated, when classifying triples (i.e. facts) as true or false, users must define relationspecific thresholds, which can be awkward for graphs with a great number of relation types.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to focus on calibration for knowledge embeddings. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we use Platt Scaling and isotonic regression to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models on datasets that include ground truth negatives. One peculiar feature of knowledge graphs is that they usually rely on the open world assumption (facts not present are not necessarily false, they are simply unknown). This makes calibration troublesome because of the lack of ground truth negatives. For this reason, our second and main contribution is a calibration heuristics that combines Platt-scaling or isotonic regression with synthetically generated negatives.Experimental results show that we obtain better-calibrated models and that it is possible to calibrate knowledge graph embedding models even when ground truth negatives are not present.

In this paper, we explore a question that has been given little attention: &quot;when to distill such knowledge.&quot; The question is answered in our work with the concept of model calibration; we view a teacher model not only as a source of knowledge but also as a gauge to detect miscalibration of a student. This simple and yet novel view leads to a hard gate knowledge distillation scheme that switches between learning from a teacher model and training data. We verify the gating mechanism in the context of natural language generation at both the token-level and the sentence-level.

We compare generations across diverse prompts and show that these can be used to create confidence scores. By utilizing more prompts we can get more precise confidence estimates and use response diversity as a proxy for confidence. We evaluate this approach across ten multiple-choice questionanswering datasets using three models: T0, FLAN-T5, and GPT-3. In addition to analyzing multiple human written prompts, we automatically generate more prompts using a language model in order to produce finer-grained confidence estimates. Our method produces more calibrated confidence estimates compared to the log probability of the answer to a single prompt.

We introduce a region-balanced calibration error metric that weights all certainty regions equally. When low and mid certainty estimates are taken into account, calibration error is typically larger than previously reported. We introduce a simple extension of temperature scaling, requiring no additional computation, that can reduce both traditional and region-balanced notions of calibration error over existing baselines."><td>15</td><td>Region-dependent temperature scaling for certainty calibration and application to class-imbalanced token classification</td><td>0.480</td></tr><tr class="has-abs" data-abs="NLP practitioners often want to take existing trained models and apply them to data from new domains.

Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about the task with model attributions generated by black box interpretation techniques, then uses a simple calibrator, in the form of a classifier, to predict whether the base model was correct or not. We experiment with our method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language inference, covering adaptation from several pairs of domains with limited target-domain data. The experimental results across all the domain pairs show that explanations are useful for calibrating these models, boosting accuracy when predictions do not have to be returned on every example.

In many settings however, the quality of posterior probability itself (e.g., 65% chance having diabetes), gives more reliable information than the final predicted class alone. When these methods are shown to be poorly calibrated, most fixes to date have relied on posterior calibration, which rescales the predicted probabilities but often has little impact on final classifications. Here we propose an end-to-end training procedure called posterior calibrated (PosCal) training that directly optimizes the objective while minimizing the difference between the predicted and empirical posterior probabilities. We show that PosCal not only helps reduce the calibration error but also improve task performance by penalizing drops in performance of both objectives. Our PosCal achieves about 2.5% of task performance gain and 16.1% of calibration error reduction on GLUE (Wang et al.,  2018)  compared to the baseline. We achieved the comparable task performance with 13.2% calibration error reduction on xSLUE (Kang and Hovy, 2019), but not outperforming the two-stage calibration baseline. PosCal training can be easily extendable to any types of classification tasks as a form of regularization term.

Furthermore, SLiC shows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative ways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets.
